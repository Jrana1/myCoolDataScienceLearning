            "following directly from where the story left off in part one, the second half which sets about telling the inevitable downfall and much more grim side of the man's legacy is exactly as such. in direct contrast to the first feature, part two represents a shift from che the pride and glory of a revolutionised country, to chestruggling liberator of a country to which he has no previous ties. the change of setting isn't just aesthetic; from the autumn and spring greys of the woodlands comes a change of tone and heart to the feature, replacing the optimism of the predecessor with a cynical, battered and bruised reality aligned to an all new struggle. yet, as che would go on to say himselfsuch a struggle is best told exactly as thata struggle. while part one certainly helped document that initial surge to power that the revolutionary guerrilla acquired through just that, part two takes a much more refined, callous and bleak segment of che's life and ambition, and gives it an assertive portrayal that is both poignant and tragic in a tangible, easy to grasp manner.while the movie's tone in some regards does stray off and differ quite drastically from part one however, there still remains that same documented approach taken a month ago that avoids melodrama and fabrication as much as possible. this somewhat distant, cold approach to telling che's story and struggle will no doubt turn some viewers off; indeed, i still remain reserved about whether or not the feature itself should have been named after one manif anything, the entirety of che, taken as a whole, delivers a tale that goes beyond mere biography and instead documents a man's struggle alongside those who helped carry him along the way. by no means does soderbergh try to paint a humanistic portrait here akin to what hirschbiegel did with der untergang half a decade ago (excuse the ironic contrast); che is a slow moving, reserved and meditative approach to telling a history lesson that just happens to be narrated by the one man who arguably- conducted the whole thing.yet by moving from the lush green landscapes of cuba and retreating to the bleak, decaying backdrop of bolivia for part two, the story does inevitably take on a distinctly contrasting tone that doesn't feel too disjointed from its predecessor, but does enough to give it its own reference points. here, the basic structure of part one is echoed backthere's the initial struggle, the battles, the fallen comrades and the recruiting of those to replace them, all the while we see some glimpses of the man behind the movement. yet, as anyone with the vaguest idea of the actual history behind the feature will know, part two is destined to end on a much more underwhelming, and disquieting note. this difference, in combination with the similarities to part one, make a compelling and memorable whole; by all means, both could be digested one their own (and kudos to soderbergh for achieving as such) and enjoyed as they are, but taken as one statement, che delivers exactly what it sets out to achieve.indeed, everything that made part one the treat that it was one month prior is still evident here from the subtle yet engrossing performances from the central cast to the slow building, realistically structured combat scenesthe drama inherent to the characters on screen is just as vague and indiscernible, but with a feature such as this, part two once again proves that avoiding such elements don't necessarily hurt a film when there is enough plot and reflection on other elements to keep the viewer engaged. in fact, upon writing this review i was at odds as to whether or not to simply add a paragraph or two to my initial review for part one, and title the review as a whole, yet i felt that to do so would only serve to disillusion those who may sit down to watch the entirety of both films consecutively.with that said, i cannot rightfully decree whether or not che holds up to the task of engaging an audience for its sprawling four hour plus runtime, but upon viewing both segments i can at least attest to each part's ability to do just that. with a reflective, intricate screenplay combined with endlessly mesmerising photography and nuanced performances that do justice to the movie's characters without drawing attention to themselves, che part two is every bit as compelling and rewarding as its predecessor, but this time with a tragic but uplifting, reaffirming conclusion fit for the history pages of film.- a review by jamie robert ward (http://www.invocus.net)\n",

            "this quasi j-horror film followed a young woman as she returns to her childhood village on the island of shikoku to sell the family house and meet up with old friends. she finds that one, the daughter of the village priestess, drowned several years earlier. she and fumiko (another childhood friend) then learn that sayori's mother is trying to bring her back to life with black magic. already the bonds between the dead and living are getting weak and the friends and villagers are seeing ghosts. nothing was exceptional or even very good about this movie. unlike stellar j-horror films, the suspense doesn't really build, the result doesn't seem overly threatening and the ending borders on the absurd.this movie is like plain white rice cooked a little too long so that it is bordering on mushy. sometimes you get this at poor asian restaurants or cook your own white rice a little too long. you end up eating it, because you need it with the meal, because what is chinese or japanese food without rice, but it almost ruins the meal because of the gluey, gooey tastelessness of it all. 3/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies\n",

            "the basic plot of 'marigold' boasts of a romantic comedy wherein the film industry is kept as a backdrop. an american actress marigold, played by ali carter gets stuck in india. worse that, she is out of money. she then decides to play a small role in a bollywood musical, so that she can earn enough money to get back to her nation. here she gets to meet indian choreographer prem, played by salman khan. basically, the movie fails at the script level. just by calling a film a hollywood venture doesn't guarantee quality cinema. marigold stands out as the best example. the art direction is weak and outdated. musically, marigold turns out to be a dud. shankar-ehsaan-loy's is far from being acknowledged as a decent hear. actingwise, salman delivers of his most amateurish performances till date. ali larter is good and has immense screen presence. performance wise too, she is good.one can also find good reviews regarding this movie at http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=36310\n",

            "the angry red planet (quickie review) like \"the man from planet x,\" this is a bizarre science fiction tale culled from an era where fantasy and science fiction were still damn near the same thing. meaning, we have some highly laughable special effects and rampant pseudo-science masquerading as science fiction. and yes, it's another \"classic\" released in a high quality transfer with a crisp picture and sharp sound--by midnite movies.so, the main reason to watch this film? oh, it's definitely the whole time our space crew is on mars. (what, you thought \"angry red planet\" referred to neptune?) prior to that is some rather poor quality space crew boarding a space ship, inside of which they smoke and toss around sexist chauvinistic banter aimed at the \"puny female\" member of the crew. it'd be somewhat offensive by today's standards if it weren't so damn funny. but mars is the real reason we're watching this thing. the film is generally black and white, but mars, well mars is screaming bloody red. it's filmed in this bizarre red plasticy sheen giving the angry red planet quite an interesting look of overexposed redness. it's really quite a sightas are the (ha ha) aliens viewers are to witness. the best being the \"ratbatspidercrab.\" you think that's a joke? that's what they call it in the movie! it's a gigantic chimera (small puppet) of a thing combining traits of rats, bats, spiders, and crabs. it bounds along all puppety and scares the sh*t out of our \"heroic crew.\" there are other weird, and poorly imagined, aliens to be seen, but that one takes the cake. eventually, after their harrowing experience on mars, the sexist crew boards their \"ship\" and returns to whatever planet it was they came from.this ain't for everyone. science fiction film buffs & curiosity seekers, and some general film buffs. fans of mystery science theater 3000 will have a field day with this one (if they never got to it on the show).2/10 modern score, 6/10 nostalgia score, 4/10 overall.(www.residenthazard.com)\n",

            "i think that mario van peebles movie posse is a very important film. it is an excellent entry point film to a side of history many are not aware of. this is a story of early black settlers, cow boys and infantrymen returning from the spanish-american war with a cache of gold. the main character peebles is haunted by memories of his murdered father. the racism applied to the new black settlers and infantryman is explored in this film with excellent casting including melvin van peebles (marios father), billy zane, stephen baldwin and a wonderful performance by big daddy kane. one senses that peeples strived to use as many notable black (and some not so notable - smile) actors as possible : ) perhaps too many, some notable persons (issac hayes, pamela grier) are only scene in cameo, others briefly such as tone loc. the sentiment and efforts of peebles efforts to expose these actors will be understood by some. the large cast (a feat for any director) work well and do a good job of telling the story in the classic \"revenge and fight vs justice\" western.most noteworthy was the wonderful narrative role of veteran actor woody strode (from once upon a time in the west), who's own life was a barrier-breaker, within the context of a previous era not yet completed faded from memory. no other actor could have done this role better. read the mini-bio on woody strode here as a primer: http://imdb.com/name/nm0834754/bio the film does a good job of balancing action with a bit of sardonic humour. the dialog was excellent if a bit contemporary! and as others have mentioned the profanity was not accurate to that period. the sex scene was a bit much -- not really needed. there are some historical inaccuracies such as the seeming electronic branding of the cattle etc. but posse is a good effort to hopefully open the door for more historical and creative works reflective of other untold stories and events. the actual photos of real cowboys at the end credits was very nice touch.\n",

            "this dvd is barely 30 minutes long, and has dull interviews that reveal that the average slipknotian has an iq of around 30. but these aspects are the least problematic here.the real trouble is that slipknot is one of the least talented metal bands to ever sell over 100,000 units of their crap. (the only reason i say \"one of the\" instead of \"the\" is because system of a down are even worse.) much like ed gein's girlfriends, this band's music is pieced together from age-old metal clichés, which are to be found in both their image and their ultra-dull music. in fact, their image is kind of fun; their videos are like snippets from cheesy horror films hence they fulfill at least some purpose as entertainment.their music, however, consists of nothing of quality - whatsoever: just a bunch of gimmicky, heard-them-a-million-times-before played-solely-at-the-guitar-neck riffs that are in no way related to each other and yet are randomly grouped together to form \"songs\" that have no cohesion, no highlights, no nothing. but if the riffs are truly bad, then the vocals are even worse: slipknot's singer has a stereotypical hence uninteresting \"evil\" growl - the kind 90% of all metal bands today have - but that is nothing compared to when this deluded hick starts trying to sing! still, what could one expect? rule no.39 of the \"nu metal\" handbook says quite clearly: \"you will alternately growl and sing. ignore the fact that the two styles don't mix well, because most of your fans are so tone-deaf they will love you even if you **** into the microphone.\" slipknot are at their absolute worst when their \"singer\" starts belching out \"melodies\".but back to their image. it's stolen, copied, ripped off, nicked, borrowed, taken without asking from none other than mr.bungle. you've never heard of them? of course you haven't. you only listen to nu-metal, and mr.bungle is quite far from that, and beyond any categorization anyway. they too wore masks - grotesque, horror ones, similar to those of slipknot, i might add - in the late 80s and early 90s. this band, whose frontman is mike patton from faith no more, never hit it big because their music wasn't directed toward the average music fans (to put it mildly).so, basically slipknot aren't even original in the image department. they have nothing at all new to offer hence will be forgotten in several years: once the masks become boring to the legions of their zit-faced fans, which is when slipknot will be forced to compete in the music market solely with their generic music.speaking of mike patton, it's interesting that a number of nu-metal bands often site his singing as a major influence. predictably - and thankfully - patton is not flattered by this and has denied being in any way proud to have been an influence for one of the worst metal sub-genres ever...having said that, enjoy this short dvd and the cheap thrills it might provide to the untrained ear and bored eye... and then polish those slipknot posters, because in a few years no-one will be taking care of them, the poor dears.having seen corey in the documentary \"get thrashed\", i finally understand why he wears a mask: he is a blue-eyed baby-faced ginger, looking like dave mustaine's younger brother! not exactly scary.for more of my music-world rants, go to: http://rateyourmusic.com/collection/fedor8/1please punish me hard, very hard, by clicking \"no\" below. that'll teach me...\n",

            "pendragon pictures' new film \"h g wells' war of the worlds\", the first faithful adaptation of the original novel, has been in development for about 5 years. a theatrical release was intended for earlier this year (march, 2005) but this never happened. the dvd was rushed out to coincide with the release of spielberg's version, which hits theatres june 29.i liked this film, with certain reservations.how faithful is the adaptation? it's not quite 100% faithful to wells' book, but 90 - 95% faithful is good enough for me. at least several scenes were totally new, such as ogilvy the astronomer's confrontation with a farmer, and the unnamed writer/narrator awkwardly having tea with his cousin. but on the whole, this film follows the book very closely -- certainly much more than the classic 1953 version by george pal.its greatest fault is that it was obviously made on a very cheap budget. the majority of it seems to have been shot blue-screen and composited with digitally rendered backgrounds. this is particularly annoying during most of the interior shots, and scenes of crowded city streets. the overviews of 1898 london look like something from a video game. numerous scenes in horse-carriages were faked -- i guess they couldn't afford to rent a horse. the only scenes shot for \"real\" seem to be those in open fields or forests.but within those budget restrictions, they managed to do quite a lot. artistically, the film looks right. the martians and their tripods are quite well done, and very true to wells' descriptions. i was particularly impressed with the heat ray. although the thunder child sequence, which should have been one of the film's highlights, is very disappointing. it's a great shame that they couldn't afford more actual sets, or better quality animation.the acting and direction won't win any oscars. for the most part, they are competent, not bad, but not outstanding. the music is quite good also, though not on a par with any of the major hollywood composers.i'm actually glad this didn't get a theatrical release, because the budget limitation would have made it look much worse on a big screen. as it stands, i would rate this similarly to a bbc-tv adaptation of classic literature.a few nitpicks: most of the scenes are presented with various colored filters (mostly red). this may have been an artistic choice, but it is used very inconsistently, and seems more like a sloppy job of mastering the dvd. and the writer/narrator's obviously fake moustache mutates from scene to scene.bottom line -- is it worth seeing? if you can look past the technical and budgetary limitations, and get into the story, i think you will enjoy this, especially if you've actually read the original h g wells novel. if, however, you are easily put off by cheap production values, you'd best pass on this (unless you're a mst3k fan). be warned, however that the film runs a full 3 hours, so i don't recommend watching it all in one sitting.btw: an entirely different version of war of the worlds (aka \"invasion\") came out on dvd the same month that spielberg's hit the theatres: http://imdb.com/title/tt0449040/. this was also made on a budget, but is updated to the present day like the spielberg film - but it's much better! and to top it off, jeff wayne is making an animated film of his best-selling album from 1978, but that won't be out until 2007.\n",

            "chop shop, the second feature from ramin bahrani, is a rare breed. it is an american film that tells a story not usually found in american cinema, the story of the of a minority living in poverty. it is a work of simple beauty. shot on location in queens, new york in the shadows of shea stadium, chop shop is neo-realism to the core. featuring a cast of non-actors, it has more in common with vittorio de sica's classic bicycle thieves than anything made in the united states. there is no score or soundtrack, all the music and sounds are diagetic. watching it feels like watching a great foreign film, it takes us to another world because it is so uncommon to see. however this other world is not post-world war ii rome or istanbul or new delhi, it is contemporary new york city.bahrani tells the story of alejandro (alejandro polanco), better known as ale. he is a 12-year-old latin-american kid with no parents or family unit to watch after him. he lives in a tiny room upstairs in the auto shop that he also works at. he shares the same bed with his teenage sister isamar (isamar gonzales). neither of them have made it passed second grade. ale, though young, is tough and mature. he acts as the head of the small family. he hooks his sister up with a job, and he himself does anything he can to make a buck when not working at the chop shop. he sells bootleg dvds on the streets and candy in subways. he searches for scrap auto parts and sells them to the many auto shops lining the street where he lives.alejandro is heartbroken when he learns his sister is working nights as a prostitute. he himself becomes progressively disinterested in abiding by the law. he begins to steal, first car parts and later wallets. like antonio, the desperate protagonist in bicycle thieves, we cannot blame ale for becoming a thief. it is merely survival. ale and isamar save up in hopes of buying a food vending van for $4,500. they see the van as their way out, and there is much optimism. however, as is usually the case in neo-realism, we know this will only lead to disappointment.polanco's riveting performance is what gives legitimacy to chop shop's realism. here is a 12-year-old character that needs to be believably independent and vulnerably naive. whether he is directing cars to the shop, selling movies and snickers bars or playing with his sister in their scanty room, it is authentic.chop shop is a sobering reminder that not all american children grow up in a land of opportunity. ale's lifestyle is what many in middle-class white america consider 'third world'. they act cognizant the poverty and deprivation in foreign lands while sipping their coffee and reading the new york times on sunday morning, but make themselves blind to it on their own streets. once you watch chop shop, you will think differently of the kids peddling candy on the subway.more reviews at www.mediasickness.com\n",

            "first things first: i'm not a conservative. and even though i would never refer to myself as a liberal or a democrat, i was opposed to the war in iraq from day one. i think it's safe to say john cusack and i would probably see eye-to-eye on politics, in fact, i'm sure we'd become drinking buddies if we ever got to talking about how great adam curtis' bbc docs are. my point is this: don't discredit this review by thinking i'm not a part of the choir cusack is preaching to in war, inc. there's no question wi's politics are tailored to appeal to my demographic, but the problem is, the tailoring is substandard and the the film cusack co- wrote, produced and stars in, fits worse than a cheap suit.as they say \"the road to hell is paved with good intentions.\" cusack, his co-writers, director joshua seftel and even the actors involved, no doubt had every intention of making an anti- war film every bit as biting and funny as robert altman's m*a*s*h, unfortunately for the viewer, they ended up with one as unfunny and unintelligent as michael moore's canadian bacon.the current state of us politics, foreign policy and the war \"effort\" is already absurd and, as a result, tragic, pathetic and, regrettably comical -- just watch the daily show and see for yourself. the bottom line is: you can't write material as funny as what the bush administration provides us on a daily basis, so why try to compete?the main problem with wi is that it feels it was put together in a hurry. to get it done, cusack basically cannibalized grosse pointe blank (one of his best films), changed the setting and crammed in a shopping list of ideas lifted from the collected works of naomi klein. most of these ideas are rammed down your throat in the first twenty minutes of the film and what makes them so obnoxious is none of the jokes or gags or deliberately obvious references to halliburton, the neo-cons and the us occupation of iraq, are imaginative, clever or funny. the writers are so blinded by their \u0010own dogma they felt that by simply referencing these issues the film would be funny and subversive. the trouble is...it isn't. by now these ideas are yesterday's news and unless you've been living under or rock or are so blinded by ignorance, denial and sheer stupidity (read: a right-wing christian), these jokes insultingly simple.perhaps wi would work if it was more nuanced, subversive, offensive and fattened up with detailed research/insights into the occupation. as it is, the jokes and sight gags are all surface and are so bad, with so little finesse, subtlety or satirical wickedness, they did little more than make me groan. homer simpson once said \"it's funny 'cause it's true\" and the daily show proves this every night; war, inc. however proves that just because it's true doesn't make it funny. the bottom line: hyperbole isn't required when it comes to lampooning us/neo-conservative politics...it's already a big enough joke.http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/\n",

            "laid up and drugged out, as a kidney stone wended its merry way through my scarred urinary tract, with absolutely nothing better to do than let the painkillers swoon me into semi-oblivion, i happened to catch this movie on cable. i wouldn't want anyone to think that i paid to view it in a cinema, or rented it, or  heaven forfend!  that i watched it straight.having played this sensationally gruesome video game and avidly trod the doomed rooms and dread passageways of the house, battling chariot (type 27), the hanged man (type 041), and other impossible sentinels, my curiosity was piqued as to how the game would transfer to the movie screen.it doesn't.the banal plot revolves around a group of \"crazy kids\"  a la scooby doo  attending a remote island for a world-shaking \"rave\"  whatever that is. (you kids today with your hula-hoops and your mini-skirts and your pat boone) after bribing a boat captain thousands in cash to ferry them there (a stupidity which begs its own network of rhetoric), they find the \"rave\" deserted.passing mention is made of a \"house\"  presumably the titular house of the dead  but most of the action takes place on fake outdoor sets and other locales divorced from any semblance of haunted residence.a fallen video camera acts as flashback filler, showing the island in the throes of a  party?! is that it? oh, so this \"rave\" thingy is just a \"party\"? in the grand tradition of re-euphemizing \"used cars\" as \"pre-owned\", or \"shell shock\" as \"post-traumatic stress disorder\", the word \"party\" is now too square for you drug-addled, silicone-implanted, metrosexual jagoffs? it is learned that the party was broken up by rampaging zombies. intelligent thought stops herei don't think the pinheads who call themselves screenwriters and directors understand the mythos behind zombie re-animation. zombies can't die  they're already un-dead. they do not bleed, they know no pain. unless their bodies are completely annihilated, they will continue being animated. at least, that's what my jamaican witch priestess tells me.which means that a .45 shot into their \"hearts\" is not going to stop them, nor will a machete to the torso. and a shotgun blast to the chest will certainly not bring forth gouts of blood. at least in the video game's logic, the shooter pumps so many rounds into each monster that it is completely decimated, leaving a fetid mush that cannot re-animate itself.yet each actor-slash-model gets their matrix-circular-camera moment, slaying zombies on all fronts with single bullets and karate chops to the sternum. seriously, these zombies are more ineffective than the stormtroopers from \"return of the jedi\", who get knocked out when ewoks trip them.i suppose the film's writer, mark altman, having penned the not-too-shabby \"free enterprise\", felt compelled to insert a captain kirk reference, in the character of jurgen prochnow, who must have needed milk money desperately to have succumbed to appearing in this aromatic dung-swill. there is also a reference to prochnow's primo role in the magnificent \"das boot\", when one of the untrained b-actors mentions that he \"looks like a u-boat captain\". \". i wonder how many of this movie's target audience of square-eyed swine picked up on any of the snide references to other films, as when prochnow declares, \"say hello to my little friend\", presaging his machine gun moment. aimed at a demographic who have not the wherewithal to comprehend the sisyphean futility of the video-game concept (i.e. the game ends when you die  you cannot win), this is merely a slasher film for the mindless and mindless at heart. accordingly, everyone dies in due course, except for a heterosexual pair of attractive white people.a better use for this film's scant yet misused budget might have been to send the cast through acting school, although ona grauer's left breast did a good job, as did her right breast  and those slomo running scenes: priceless! i especially liked the final scene with ona trying to act like she's been stabbed, but looking like she's just eaten ice cream too fast.attempting to do something more constructive with my time, i pulled out my digitally-restored, 35th anniversary, special edition, widescreen anamorphic dvd of \"manos: the hands of fate.\" ah, yes!  the drugs were suitably brain-numbing - now here was some quality film-making(movie maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)\n",

            "this is an interesting left turn for reel 13 indies. two harbors is a b&w 75 minute film from minnesota that features non-actors and is about two people finding a connection through a search for alien life. i applaud the boldness of the reel 13 programmers of thinking out-of-the-box when selecting this film. i just wish they had picked a stronger film to be bold with. as a matter of fact, i wonder if the choice had more to do with the uniqueness of the film than with the actual quality of the film itself (not that two harbors is completely without merit, but i'll get to that a little later). as is common with independent films, two harbors is limited in terms of location. there are only two real locations  a large junk dealership market and a very teeny trailer, which is the home of the middle-aged main character, vic, played by alex cole. writer/director james vculek uses the market setting to provide exposition about vic, who is one of the dealers there. he has various people walk up to vic and start very long conversations that provides us with just two pieces of information  vic sells space toys (he prefers to call them \"outer space action figures\") and he is a caustic asshole. this is emblematic of one of the two key problems with two harbors - all the chatting. i've said it before and i'll say it again  we are dealing with a visual medium and filmmakers need to work harder to tell their stories visually. there are exceptions, of course, but generally, endless patter is not so engaging on film  particularly if the dialogue is being used as exposition. pretty much all the conversations in the film are long and unnecessarily verbose. a notable example would be a few scenes which feature vic trying to play himself off as a boy scout leader in order to get a discount at a store. he argues with the clerk back and forth and these scenes don't even advance the plot one iota. this is the kind of thing that makes even a 75 minute film feel long.the other problem with two harbors is the acting. i may be a bit of a curmudgeon when it comes to performance in film, but i really don't feel like there's a good excuse for not having good actors in your films. there are plenty of good actors out there, many of which willing to work on low-budget projects  even in minnesota. many filmmakers eschew the importance of acting ability as being secondary to their visuals, but that is naïve. in narrative film-making, next to the story, nothing is more important than the acting/performances. if you don't believe the people enacting your story, your audience is lost.originally, i thought vculek was using non-actors, but as the film went on, i decided that they were probably community theater-type actors. it wasn't that they were uncomfortable on camera. it's that they were overly theatrical (i.e. big). granted, the best of the actors were the two leads  cole and catherine e. johnson as cassie, a lonely young girl that gets caught up in vic's extra-terrestrial hunt. they seemed to have the most training, but they were still a little rough around the edges. the eccentricities they displayed seemed to be surface only - not coming from a real, organic place within. ms. johnson, in particular, is an interesting case. she definitely has a presence  a midwestern charm about her, but that charisma belies the multitude of issues her character is supposed to have. she struggles to portray the idiosyncrasies that stem from a supposed life of solitude and (slave?) labor, relying on stock gestures like eye rolls, lip biting and stammering to suggest her discomfort with the outside world.i mentioned in the first paragraph that two harbors is not completely without merit and here's what i mean. without giving too much away, there is a fade to white an hour into the film. after that, the story takes a stunning turn, which allows the last fifteen minutes to be evocative and downright powerful  it's like a sucker punch to the gut, but in a good way. it's almost a huge relief to feel something after so long with these characters. the last five minutes of the film don't have any dialogue at all and the result is the best part of the film  subtle, detailed (cole does his best work of the film) and most importantly, cinematic. then, with the closing credits comes the most staggering revelation of all  that it's based on a true story, which got me to thinking. with all the dialogue, the minimal locations and the lack of cinematic qualities, it occurred to me that with two kick ass actors and a tightening re-write, two harbors might make a really kick-ass stage play  maybe even a one-act. if there are any bold theater producers out there reading this, i definitely recommend seeing if you can get a hold of the film and contact the filmmaker, reel 13 or whomever. there might be something to this story after all(for more information on this or any other reel 13 film, check out their website at www.reel13.org)\n",

            "alone in the dark is uwe boll's kick in the nuts to hollywood after house of the dead's punch in the face.if anything it proves just how much of a master manipulator boll is. after forcing artisan out of business over the flop that was house of the dead, one can only assume the normally credible lion's gate films only released aitd under contractual obligation after acquiring artisan's assets. because aitd is an even bigger example of complete lack of coherent film-making ability, plot exposition and just plain stealing poorly from other movies because it was supposed to look cool instead of because it fitted within the movie's framework.but then that's the point, isn't it. boll isn't trying to make a coherent film because he isn't trying to direct alone in the dark. he's just trying to manipulate hollywood.alone in the dark, like house of the dead, dungeon siege, far cry, bloodrayne and the other 3 or 4 projects that are \"announced\" or in \"pre-production\".these aren't movies to be directed, but investment portfolios. every single one of them rushed into production under the pretence that the tax law boll and his investors are exploiting may be closed within the next 2 to 3 years. the more bomb projects he can release within that time-frame, the more money he and his investors can gain. why bother making a good movie when a bad movie's making you a mint anyway? the result is movies like the awfulness of alone in the dark.alone in the dark, like all his other movies are just a cynical exploitation of hollywood's current trend for lazy film-making.and to those who support boll by calling him misunderstood or the next ed wood, congratulations, by making a cult figure out of the man, you're just making it easier for him to get investors but giving him notoriety.for more information, read here: http://www.cinemablend.com/feature.php?id=209 http://www.cinemablend.com/forum/showthread.php?s=&threadid=21699 as an aside, just don't ask me how he's getting his cast-lists together. unless the actors are in on the investment-scam somehow, that mystery has still to be uncovered.\n",

            "hi all i am a chess enthusiast since the age of about 6. i supposed i am quite obsessed by chess, but hopefully not as much as the central character in this film.in this film, the central character reflects a real chess player called curt von bardeleben who committed suicide in 1924. he is famous for a game he played against steinitz, where a beautiful combination was played by steinitz. instead of resigning, he simply walked out of the tournament hall, never to return.the social ineptness of the central character is unfortunately a treat of some of the more serious grandmasters you sometimes get in chess tournaments. chess i suppose is a very big sacrifice, and you can sometimes end up imbalanced in other areas of life. a major example of this is the chess legend bobby fischer. although a genius, he was also very disturbed in many ways.in the film, a world championship match is depicted, as between an italian grandmaster and luzhin. the format is a knockout, which actually the world governing body of fide has sometimes employed as a format itself - going from 128 players to just 2 in the final. but this was a group knockout - which also depicts a realistic format, where the winners of each group play against each other.the position before adjournment makes for a fascinating chess puzzle in itself. in fact, i have done a youtube video about it, for you to explore the winning combination in detail - enjoy! http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=xzptdtphwdm best wishes tryfon\n",

            "in trying to keep up with the hipness of youthful audiences as the 70s approached, oacd,ycsf was the product of odder and odder material selected for musicalization. here it's past life regression, esp and hypno-therapy... pretty loopy! the real problem with the concept (music or not) are the extraordinarily low dramatic stakes; just where can a movie go, and what can happen, when a man falls in love with a previous incarnation of a girl he can't stand? it can't go any place new, but strangely, it can't even go any place old! indeed, if it could, audiences would still have no interest in the union of yves montand (playing a much older, arrogant, french ass) and streisand. (a much younger girl). we never become invested in them, their situations or outcomes. montand is miscast and his strong accent makes many of his lyrics unintelligible.it's all been given a shallow 60s veneer that makes it eminently disposable; despite efforts here and there from minelli that are respectable. it's not even adapted from a non-musical story that met with any previous success... that's just too passe! streisand occasionally has some funny business to offer, as when she's trying not to fall asleep on her roof and improvises an energetic dance. but she over-relies on her ingratiating (translation: irritating) kooky, jewish girl shtick. she can however sing very well, at both the \"gentle\" and \"powerhouse\" ends of the range. amidst a score of musical dross, she gets 3 or 4 amazing songs* of much higher caliber than anything fanny or dolly had to offer. 'he isn't you' is a sweet trifle as sublime as lorenz hart's 'my funny valentine,' but the movie isn't able to realize any impact from it; because the lyrics don't seem to be referring to anything in the movie, and nothing remotely suggests a great love is blossoming between chabot and melinda.the only cut we can view is a poor hatchet job of a much bigger film. strong research shows a longer, better-explained and more decorative, but not necessarily a better film at: http://barbra-archives.com/films/clear_day_streisand_2.html. you can be sure there's be more babs in that version but more importantly, there'd be more thoughtful work from minelli.in the end montand sends babs off to sing the title song, after she discovers he's a total dick who feeds her a self-esteem homily to allow himself off the hook. and she takes the bait. so, uh... hooray for that.(*hurry it's lovely up here, love with all the trimmings, he isn't you, & the title song)\n",

            "again, like many other tv shows, a certain actor/actresses in thrust into the limelight, in this case miranda cosgrove, having built up her reputation in previous movies/series (especially by nickelodeon and dan schneider. she is now the star of the show, gets to sing the soundtrack ( which she did not write and thus gets even more fame from that). wonderful? it creates as much imbalance in popularity vs her other co-stars, especially nathan kress, who is continually thrust into minor rolls in each episode, except idont want to fight. cosgrove's music would never have met the charts without this show and her singing the main theme song (which was not written by her) and other covers such as about you now and stay my baby. let's not forget that she lip sync/sings her song live too. is that how you create vocalist nowadays?back to the show, cosgrove reveals more physically by acting scenes in a bikini, hawaiian hula type bra and mentioned bra many times through out. bras and seen in many cases (though not of the other actresses). wedgies are mentioned, panties have been mentioned once. og let us not forget \"oh my god\" a come phrase (are any of the scriptwriters/actors christian?) granted that the show is not meant to be just for kids, i'm surprised at the multitude of mentions of the female undergarment, especially in the first episode, where the phrase \"pointy boobs\" were mentioned. i'm not sure whether kids would thus refrain from saying that at home/in school afterwards. it's not that i'm against the mentioning or showing of female undergarments (which girls will wear), but for a show from nickelodeon, the people in charge should have realised that kids would get the exposure to such stuff. i doubt that other nickelodeon shows have such content in them.as mentioned is other reviews, the laughter track is extremely annoying and unnecessary in many parts--for example, when the character sam cries, how on earth is that a time to laugh? it distracts people from getting the joke and is used almost in every sentence.as mentioned, cosgrove is made the star of the show and thus gains the utmost fame and support from die hard fans, who even scolded a hotel staff when she is told to keep her noise level down (see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk0gtfuk98u). jennette mccurdy is the second star of the show but she faces competition from cosgrove in the music industry (compare the popularity of her new single vs cosgrove's covers). as noted, the third co-star nathan kress is the least noted of the lot. he is portrayed as a atypical boy who suffers the brunt of bullying by a girl and other boys but somehow a wizard at technology. his height in early episodes make him a cute actor but unusual given his character's crush on carly/cosgrove. beyond that, kress isn't breaking into the music industry and as cosgrove's fame grows with each episode, kress falls behind. i would bet that he is the least paid of all the three actors.the content of the show is of course fictional, but also lets one wonder how it fits into a comedy series at certain times (thus the laughter track is used).it also contains several continuity errors (how can your father be and air force colonel on a submarine? us special forces have their own branches, and the air force doesn't use us submarines--that is for seals). a unique feature is that of allowing viewers to submit their own videos to be shown during or after the episodes, but again the videos somehow do not meet the theme of comedy.once again, it is a show that is riddled with mentions of the female undergarments, exposure of skin, and over used laughter tracks. it is a series which thrusts a teen actress so far into the crowd such that her songs/actions are excessive supported by her fans, leaving her co stars behind.\n",

            "near the closing stages of baby mama, one of the central characters goes on to describe the basic outline of everything that came before and summarises that it 'was all just a mess'; i really couldn't say it any better than that. and while the feature does have its odd ray of hope every now and again, the vast majority of what is present is too neutered to be considered relevant and too unremarkable to be worth anyone's time. a lacklustre cast, mundane script and vague, caricature characters ensure that baby mama certainly isn't taxing on the ol' noggin, but it never makes up for this through its proposed sense of humour. consisting mainly of very routine, cliché jokes based around an odd couple (rich and poor) trying to live with each other as they prepare to bring a baby into the world, the film is far too esoteric to deliver laughs outside its very thin demographic.as a story on finding love, it's not that bad, but playing this plot line as a side-story of sorts to work alongside the comedy-orientated odd couple tangent, characterisation is notably weak, resulting in a lukewarm romance that never bubbles. as characters themselves, both central figures are mildly amusing when put together in small spaces, but when left alone quickly unravel and bare their emptiness; so while we may eventually come to find the character's interactions with each other amusing at times, the comedy never branches beyond distant chuckles; we don't feel for the characters and don't find them inherently interesting, but rather their dynamic. unfortunately however, although this dynamic works best, or at least better than the individual personas, as mentioned above, it rarely stems outside of the typical confines of the odd-couple formula.kate (tina fey) is a successful business woman who has hired working class, dumb-blonde angie (amy poehler) to be her unlikely surrogate, and after angie decides to leave hopeless husband carl (dax shepard), both eventually have to learn to live together despite their obvious differences. yes, it's the typical odd-couple premise, and one that we have already seen in this year's what happens in vegas, yet what baby mama lacks that the aforementioned movie had is both chemistry between performers and semi-layered characters. kate and angie both fail to ever show much of a personality outside of their two dimensional outline and as such both performers are neglected to play out roles that demand chemistry to produce out of thin air. in fact, the movie's only real engaging performance and character comes from the underused talents of romany malco who gets lumbered with playing a door-man. of the few times that i laughed during baby mama, most of those moments were because of this man, and the remainder usually fell to shepard.it's a rare thing of course to find a movie which embodies its script's themes in the way which its world is shot and presented to us through the camera, and yet director michael mccullers goes from page to screen effectively enough. yet, for a film about babies, multi-million dollar business and cultural stereotyping, this isn't necessarily a good thing. baby mama is grade-a, hammy, plastic tinsel-town with capital bore topped with sugar. so not only did i feel emotionally distant to the characters because of their two-dimensional nature, but i simply didn't care for the world they inhabited. the dialogue, along with sets, costumes, and the script's general themes are painted in pastel blues and pinks so much that all shades of humanity are lost in the director's incessant need to make his movie feel like a neutered fantasy; these aren't characters and that isn't our world in any way so why should i care? at the end of the day however, a romantic comedy's ultimate gauge of success or failure comes down purely to its chemistry between its love interests, and the frequency of its laughs; baby mama has little going on in any of these departments. of course to say that the film is without any value at all would be unfair. i'm sure female audiences in a similar boat as lead character kate may get a slight kick out of the proceedings, but anyone else will probably just feel numb and probably bored. in this respect baby mama avoids being unbearable, but never convinces in being anything remarkable or worthy of a look to anyone outside of its immediate audience; a comedic dud and a romantic mismatch, baby mama is too light-headed to be interesting and too shallow to be entertaining.- a review by jamie robert ward (http://www.invocus.net)\n",

            "the fox and the child is the latest film from march of the penguins filmmaker frenchman luc jacquet. the movie, which boasts just one human being in its cast, young actress bertille noël-bruneau, tells the story of the rather rare, though seemingly believable relationship between a child and a wild fox.part-nature documentary, and part-fairy tale, the film focuses on l'infant, the child, who on her way to school one day comes across the path of a wild fox in a picturesque setting, possibly france, though the exact location is never mentioned. over the coming weeks the child revisits the place where she found her fox hopeful that one of said days she will see said fox, who she begins to call lily, once again. and so it goes on. days turn to weeks, and then the summer disappears, turning to fall and then winter, promting some superb cinematography of the sweeping, white winter landscape. eventually, spring comes around again, and the young child finds her fox, and indeed does strike up a friendship with the animal. and so on.i had little to no expectation for the fox and the child. i had seen march of the penguins and was simply in awe at the film-making contained in that movie. luc jacquet is a hugely talented, and indeed rare film-maker, and i was expecting some superb, breathtaking cinematography, sweeping vistas and brilliant footage of the wildlife. this was delivered in spades. but here jacquet has a screen writing credit, and not knowing anything about the movie prior to the screening, i expected something a little different than what had previously been seen in 'march'. a fictional story.the child and the fox and the story is simple. a young, seemingly lonely child lives in a house in the middle of nowhere and walks to school, seemingly on her own, every day, seemingly without a care in the a seemingly perfect world. without the hint of an adult in sight. brilliant. so she strikes up a friendship with a fox.with a film like this, you have to dismiss your own opinion of the movie and put yourselves in the shoes of the target audience. this is a film which is aimed directly at children from the age of, i'd say, six and up. or to families who fancy a trip to the cinema with their breed one wet sunday afternoon. not a 31-year-old male who gets his kicks from films like the recent, brilliant wanted and the like. but, me being the newbie london critic, i put myself in the shoes of an excited eight-year old girl for the 95 or so minutes of the fox and the child. now, i have a few problems with this film. as a 31-year-old lad, and loyal lover of all things cinematic, i loved the wildlife and landscape photography. it's visually stunning. the direction of the animal characters is brilliantly executed -- as good as you will find on any of attenborough's efforts. as an impressionable, short attention spanning eight year old, i loved about the first half hour -- then i lost interest. it's a little repetitive and in places quite harrowing and bloody scary for a younger child, particularly the rather dark ending. as a 31-year-old male -- i was a little frightened in places. wuss.so, it's not a child's film. it's not really an adult film and i felt a little let down. is it a good family film. depends. it's educational maybe, and the film carries a message. it's definitely not a film i would pay the hard earned green to go see and i'm racking my brains to try and recommend it to a certain type of film goer. it's hard, but i know some will go see and fall in love this film. it's very european in feel and certainly if you are a fan of wildlife themed flicks, give it a try. unsure? well i'd wait for the dvd for a wet sunday afternoon in then. -- paul heath, http://www.thehollywoodnews.com, july 2008.\n",

            "as i've hopped from film to film at the sxsw film festival, this film from the opening night has stayed with me. curious, because it is a dark comedy with quite an absurdist premise.a family of hyper-stressed fundamentalists in a small community of like minds is changed by an auto accident. three of the four have the same near-death experience in which they are fully opened, as each receives a reversal of the concept of original sin (i won't spoil this scene with the specifics). the fourth, a middle school cheerleader, is not just the only one physically hurt, but also is unchanged and is now witness to what has become her crazy, apparently spiritually bankrupt, family. every new moment brings a new outrageousness as they have become innocently naked and frank in every way, horrifying her and then the community.forgiving the franklins has the most beautiful sexual awaking scene between a husband and wife that i have ever seen, to the sarah brightman song \"deliver me,\" a song that can now bring tears to my eyes.the cast is terrific. robertson dean as the dad, vince pavia as the son and aviva as the cheerleader daughter are excellent, mari blackwell plays peggy, the mom's questioning neighbor and best friend perfectly, a much more nuanced, fleshed out, real character than what might have been (everyone in middle america knows a peggy). and theresa willis positively glows as betty, the mom. there are lots of risks taken by the actors playing the three changed characters, and these risks pay off.i hope this film gets a wide release - if so, i plan to see it again.very accurate review at: http://www.fosteronfilm.com/phil/forgiving.htm\n",

            "'rise of the footsoldier' follows the unrelentingly cruel journey of gangster carlton leach and his associates through drugs, violence, sex, violence, guns, violence and did i mention violence?protagonist carlton leach (ricci harnett), member of the i.c.f (inner city firm); a group of football hooligans turned professional gangsters, guides the audience through the events leading to the 1995 'range rover killings', in which three gang members fell victim to particularly vicious professional 'hits'. leach's success as a doorman and talent for locating aptly violent friends to control unruly punters at a local nightclub launches him into the company of notorious drug dealers and gangsters, profitably benefiting from the 80s/90s rave scene and drug culture.opening with brutally realistic shots of the dead men, the viewer is left thirsty to understand what happened, but left wholly unsatisfied. the next 2 hours meander through a series of countless character introductions. each of these basically establishes yet another typical 'hard man', shows him assaulting usually undeserving victims, before probably coming to an even nastier end. what little emotional understanding the audience is allowed to form for a few of the characters (for example a family man blamed for missing drugs) is quickly destroyed when they are either anti-climactically killed, or their storyline left unresolved. the hints of a plot introduced in the beginning are inadequately concluded with vague impressions of how the murders occurred, as the events are slotted into place with little reward for persevering with the hazy muddle of previous events. this film has been made with a standard formula in mind, for an audience who prefer violence and 'ard nut' slang to an actual storyline. 'rise of the footsoldier' borrows too much from 'football factory', leaving out the good bits, demonstrating no moral ramifications of hooligan subculture or establishing empathy with the protagonist. the violence, although brilliantly shot, seems excessive and implausible because no one is around long enough for the audience to form an emotional attachment. the implication that the gangs are untouchable by the police is fair enough, but machete-wielding doormen regularly committing blatant murder in public places pushes the imagination of even the most willing viewer. the audience are left bewildered as to the relevance of many key events and developed characters that had no knock on effect on the eventual conclusion. attempted 'gritty-realism' is further destroyed with a substance called 'truth serum', which the turkish mafia use to coax honest answers from unwilling individuals. this is not the genre in which to invent psychologically unrealistic drugs, and renders the interrogation almost absurd.the actual scenes of violence (before becoming repetitive) hold some tension, spliced with rapid flashes of colour or the end of a film reel. seamlessly choreographed brawls coupled with obligatory but effective shaky hand-held camera work saves the film, but unfortunately the plot (or lack there of) limits it to a niche demographic.in essence, the events this film is based on aren't deservedly represented, and an adequately sequential storyline is sacrificed for stereotypical characters and an unoriginal plot. this film has a place in the market, but if you like a bit of brain with your brutality this one isn't for you. http://www.obsessedwithfilm.com/\n",

            "overall, i thought it a very nice movie - i hate to use the word 'nice' as it's rather dry but it was very beautiful to look at and the central performances by rupert friend and emily blunt were very strong. what i liked most was that despite the gleaming aesthetics of the costumes and the settings, all gilded and shiny, this aspect never took over the heart of the film which was good, strong writing (thank you julian fellowes :d); nothing too flamboyant or saturated with pomp, i.e not sensationalised greatly (when victoria is dragged out of bed to be informed she is now queen, well you couldn't get a less glamorous hand over of the crown). it was paced gently and every line in the film held its worth.undoubtedly the portrayal of the love between victoria and albert, though somewhat fairytale-ish on the face it, was in fact a slow burning candle and friend and blunt did well to show how effortlessly these two people 'fitted' together despite the union being initially arranged (my fave bit was when they come home after hunting and victoria simply hugs her new husband from behind; so much said without any words, that's what film is all about). blunt held her own beautifully as well, she has a face that demands your attention and i can't not mention the costumes that she wears - every one simply gorgeous. if i was blunt i would have trouble parting with any of them! the rest of the ensemble cast all played their roles well, harriet walter as queen adelaide being a highlight.the only qualm i have, is that it lacked a sense of urgency, or an event that could have made the movie a little more exciting? (it was rather tame) i don't know, i wanted 'something' to happen that would have victoria draw out some strength and prove her worth a little more. when she and albert argued, i loved it, i could have done with some more pivotal dramatic moments, though that may be just me.lastly, at the risk of sounding all patriotic, it did renew a sort of pride and awe in the crown and what it takes to be in such a position, especially in one so young. this may be in part to the fact that this film's snap shot of victoria's young life is immediately apt to what i have been writing for one character of mine in 'the sword & the scion' but nevertheless, it did flag up those feelings (for those following my book, can you guess what character victoria so aptly reflects?) it might have been in part to the film displaying how ridiculous the government were back in those times as they didn't seem to give two hoots about the poor and dispossessed of the nation, which only in turns renews appreciation that queen victoria and prince albert were so active in this domestic domain. it made the government appear rather useless - nothing much has changed then i suppose.blog on films and books: http://sempergratis.blogspot.com\n",

            "webs is a pretty odd movie, albeit slightly watchable. richard grieco plays an electrician who gets suck into a parallel earth overrun by mutant spiders, or something like that. the film itself was made with a modest budget, which explains the limited locales, and the somewhat tedious screenplay that manages to do very little with quite an interesting premise. basically a 90 minute episode of the tv show \"sliders\", and nothing more.4 out of 10(go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review and reviews of other films in the genre)\n",

            "despite the rave reviews this flick has garnered in new zealand, any hype surrounding the production is sadly undeserved. apart from a clichés-only plot, the movie is let down by some weak acting, accents, and overall lack of tension.whilst having the overall look of a big budget (for nz), the feel is decidedly small-town kiwi...has anyone not seen the brothers ?? ( http://imdb.com/title/tt0250274/ ) those who have will pick the similarities straightaway....i've heard comments that scenes like the boys playing basketball etc were shot to poke fun at the clichéd \"boys talking crap\", but it comes across as forced...i believe oscar keightley sees himself as deeply ironic, but again his delivery always seems merely vaguely self conscious.those who have any doubts left at all that samoans-living-in-nz culture has been deeply , hopefully not permanently ,affected by american speech , culture, and everything inbetween will certainly have their minds made up at the end of this movie.robbie magasiva always looks good on screen , but is let down by the script..it always rubs me up the wrong way when a \"comedy\" has scenes that are set up in such an obvious way, you are left feeling like having a good groan at the clichéd punchline - see the wanna be white boy...i know someone who found this movie hilarious -however, that person has the brains of a tadpole, and would struggle to spell her name if offered a million dollars....that kinda sums up the mentality of this flick , ok but not great , fun but not funny.....wake up nz - this is not a 5 star movie despite all the glowing (middle class white guilt ?? :-) ) reviews....my advice ? if you watch it, get drunk first!!!\n",

            "one of the more satisfying western all'italiana, johnny yuma has the freshness of many wai made during the heyday of the genre and is highly recommended for fans of the genre or offbeat, intelligent cinema.johnny yuma is, in most respects, not terribly original, but this actually does not count against it. the success of a genre film depends on how well it meets the audience's expectations as well as provides surprising variations on these expected elements. earlier, pleasing experiences are recreated but with subtle (or major) twist that provide continuing interest. the quality of the execution is also, obviously, important. a tired retread will be less successful than a sincere attempt to entertain or move the audience.given these criteria, johnny yuma succeeds. there are numerous reprises of elements from earlier films. the setting is the brutal, twisted semi-feudal twilight world of shared by many of the best \"gothic family\" westerns made 1964-1968 such as tempo di massacre (1966). the plot is a combination of the basic fistful of dollars (1964) plot and the ringo films, a fact not surprising as screenwriter fendiando di leo was involved in both. di leo was one of the best screenwriters in the popular cinema coming out of cinecitta in the 1960s-70s and his work helped provide much of the thematic continuities and coherency to the genre (along with a couple of other personalities in a few distinct circles of actors, directors, and screenwriters). in the fod plot, the protagonist arrives in town, stirs up a tense situation, then undergoes a near-death followed by a resurrection (in some films, like quella sporca storia nel west (1968) it is quite literally a crucifixion). the catholic undertone to the narrative and the symbolism is intriguing, especially given the implicit populist/explicit socialist leanings of the filmmakers and their films. the ringo plot, developed more fully by screenwriter ernesto gastaldi in a series of films starring guliano gemma, a egoistic protagonist chooses the interest of a community over his own through the medium of a relationship with a member of that community (with a healthy dash ironic uncertainty).the relationship between carradine and johnny is clearly based on that of manco/mortimer from a fistful of dollar (1965). the two scene of the exchange of the gun belts provides a clever dialog and understanding between the two. numerous films, including da uomo a uomo (1968) or even el chuncho, quién sabe? (1967), use this relationship between an older and younger man (father/son, older/younger brother, anglo adviser/adversary and peasant revolutionary) as a central dynamic to the plot.additionally, there is the focus on deception and misdirection, mazes and mirrors, that recur throughout the best early wai. the canons and pueblos of almeria become literal mazes through which protagonist and antagonist play shifting games of cat and mouse.what distinguishes johnny yuma from other wai is the quality of director romolo guerriri's use of visual/psychological space together arrangement with the script's intelligent mechanisms to forward the plot. dialogue was never very important to the wai and often absurdly unintelligible (thought there are exceptions, such as the cynical commentaries in django (1966) or faccia a faccia (1967).psychological depth of character is created almost entirely through iconic imagery, it's juxtapositions, and it's description of the overall narrative situation. see how the presence of the deadly samantha is felt during the beating scene  watching from the roof or from the background of the action. or how johnny strips samantha and pedro of their security and confidence in their power through his stealthy invasions of their ranch, hotel, even bedroom (this, again, is a theme from fod). finally, note how there is a focus on the search for information. like many elements, this is borrowed from fod which was ultimately based on the hard-boiled mystery novel red harvest. it is through incidental contacts, wanted posters, overheard conversations, glances out of windows, watches left in the dust, or mistaken identities and movements through the ripples created by the actions of pedro and samantha within this surreal and absurd reality that the narrative tacks forward to it's conclusion.the movie was notable in it's time for what were perceived of as excesses in violence. of course, these films were hardly more violent than many american westerns. what was different was the psychological intensity of the violence and the causes to which it was attributed, which is to say that it was not the violence but it's meaning that had changed. johnny yuma is distinct and interesting in it's use and portrayal of violence and this is another interesting aspect of the film.what i personally find most interesting about most of this genre is the link it provides to the anonymous, nameless audiences in italy and spain to whom these recurrent narratives held some significance and interest. the artifact may have no intrinsic worth in and of itself  some flint debitage from a prehistoric site, a shard of cruse pottery, or a moldering piece of leather and rusted metal  but it is reference to some nameless presence, lives, that were significant simply because they existed. while johnny yuma has intrinsic worth, much of it's interest for me derives from this connection and mystery.top spaghetti western list http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=21849907average sws http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=21849889for fanatics only (bottom of the barrel) http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=21849890\n",

            "this overrated, short-lived series (a measly two seasons) is about as experimental and unique as a truck driver going to a strip bar. i am not quite sure what they mean by \"ground-breaking\" and \"original\" when they fawn all over lynch and his silly little tv opus. what exactly is their criteria of what is original? sure, compared to the \"bill cosby show\" or \"hill street blues\" it's original. definitely. next to \"law & order\" tp spews originality left and right.fans of tp often say that the show was canceled because too many viewers weren't smart enough, open enough for the show's supposed \"weirdness\", its alleged wild ingenuity, or whatever. as a fan of weirdness myself, i have to correct that misconception. there is nothing too off-the-wall about tp; it is a merely watchable, rather silly whodunit that goes around in circles, spinning webs in every corner but (or because of it) ultimately going nowhere. the supposed weirdness is always forced; the characters don't behave in a strange way as much as they behave in an idiotic way half the time. there's a difference...whenever i watch the \"weird dream\" sequence in \"living in oblivion\" in which the dwarf criticizes the director (buscemi) for succumbing to the tired old let's-use-a-midget-in-a-dream-scene cliché, i think of lynch. you want weird? \"eraserhead\" is weird - in fact, it's beyond weird, it's basically abstract. you want a unique tv show? watch \"the prisoner\". you want a strange-looking cast? felini's and leone's films offer that. tp looks like an overly coiffed tv crime drama in which all the young people look like fashion models. the cast gives tp a plastic look. kens & barbies en masse.in fact, one of the producers of tp said that lynch was looking for \"unique faces\" for the series. unique faces? like lara flynn boyle's? sheryll fenn's? like those effeminate-faced \"hunks\" straight out of men's catalogs (or gay magazines)? don't get me wrong; there is nothing wrong with getting an attractive cast, especially with beauties like fenn (the way madonna would look if she were 1000 times prettier), but then don't go around saying you're making a \"weird show with weird-looking people\". and i have never understood lynch's misguided fascination with kyle maclachlan (i should get a medal for bothering to spell his name right). he is not unlikable, but lacks charisma, seeming a little too bland and polished. his character's laughable \"eccentricities\" were not at all interesting, merely one of lynch's many attempts to force the weirdness, trying hard to live up to his reputation - him having completely lost his edge but that time. everything lynch made post-\"elephant man\" was very much sub-par compared to his first two movies. what followed were often mediocre efforts that relied on lynch's relatively small but fanatical fan base to keep him in the public eye by interpreting meanings into his badly put-together stories that don't hold any water on closer scrutiny. in other words, lynch is every intellectual-wannabe's darling. so laura palmer was killed by her dad...? he was obsessed by the devil or some such nonsense. that's the best this \"great mind\" could come up with... you've got b-movie horror films that end with more originality. lynch is neither bright nor hard-working enough to come up with a terrific story.go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~fedor8, and check out my \"tv & cinema: 150 worst cases of nepotism\" list.\n",

            "anyone who visited drive-ins in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, must have seen a film or two by american international pictures, a distributor that resembled 1980s giant cannon films. wherever movie-goers ventured, aip would be right there to supply the latest en vogue titles - in the 50s came horror movies like 'voodoo woman' and 'the undead;' in the 60s were frankie avalon-annette funicello beach comedies and biker flicks like 'the glory stompers;' and into the 70s, aip churned out grindhouse-level trash like 'cannibal girls' and 'sugar hill.''dillinger,' released in 1973, is one of the more 'highbrow' aip efforts that capture the true spirit of drive-in film-making; it is one of those uneven, over-the-top flicks that satisfied the masses' thirst for entertainment, craftsmanship and common sense be damned. on the whole, 'dillinger' is typical for its era: entertaining and worth a couple of hours, but certainly not memorable. heavy on action and short on both acting and historical fact, 'dillinger' was a fair effort by screenwriter-director john milius ('magnum force') but certainly left room for improvement in his extensive career.the 109-minute 'dillinger' - epic for aip's scope - follows the quest of fbi midwest chief melvin purvis, played by academy award winner ben johnson. purvis was the investigator who sought revenge for four fbi agents killed in a 1933 kansas city ambush that helped gangster frank nash to escape justice. at large were the men who supposedly plotted that breakout, including expert bankrobber john dillinger (warren oates), pretty boy floyd (steve kanaly), and psychopath baby face nelson (richard dreyfuss). dillinger eventually joined forces with floyd and nelson, taking along homer van meter (harry dean stanton) and harry pierpont (geoffrey lewis). he also hooked up with billie frechette (michelle phillips), a prostitute of french and indian extraction. while taking place over several months in 1933-4, 'dillinger' is basically a chase film, with purvis's entourage looking to run down and kill off the men wanted by j. edgar hoover.'dillinger' has a documentary feel, listing dates and places while johnson supplies loose narrative as purvis. milius keeps an honest depression look, using authentic fashion, cars, weapons, and buildings; he also sprinkles around black-and-white photography and stock footage of gangster shootouts. the film is never boring, moving at a quick, if haphazard, pace. the action scenes are dillinger's strongpoint, edited competently by fred feitshans jr in his last professional effort. thousands of blank ammunition rounds must have been used to make this film, not to mention pounds of explosives. this film is certainly not for the squeamish, with people getting shot and dropping dead all over the place. the violence, while gratuitous, brings some understanding of the mayhem that organized crime dumped on american life.this film never transcends its exploitation status, however, because the needed writing just isn't there. john milius, somewhat overrated as a filmmaker, places way too much emphasis on action. the action scenes (mostly blood-filled shootouts) are impressive and comparable with any major crime film of its era, including 1967's 'bonnie and clyde.' but we simply don't get to know much about dillinger and his gang members as people; the vital relationship that develops between dillinger and frechette is barely touched upon, with the pair meeting in a bar during one scene and cavorting as lovers just ten minutes afterward. melvin purvis also seems to wander in and out of the storyline, becoming a prominent figure only when milius needs to keep the film from unraveling. all too often, the film takes on a shoot-'em-up persona when its characters could have been explored in detail.aside from this, the picture's main crime is ignorance of historical fact. while many say that 'dillinger' is just a film, it's films such as this one that create fables and make them permanent. those with knowledge of gangster history will point out that john dillinger was not the last of his ring to die, as milius's screenplay and the film's documentary style encourage us to believe. in fact, dillinger died before baby face nelson and homer van meter; he also was said not to be carrying a gun on the night of his death, nor did he have billie frechette in tow. while these inaccuracies might make for high drama, there is no reason why milius couldn't have stayed with the facts and written a great story around them.warren oates's performance as dillinger is quite good, although he sometimes looks unconvincing. oates is humorous and nicely portrays how dillinger became consumed by his larger-than-life image in the american press; however, we never really feel the menace he invoked in his lifetime. ben johnson gives some life to purvis, suave but rather flat. michelle phillips brings emotion to the billie frechette character and it's really too bad that milius's screenplay didn't flesh out her relationship with dillinger. we never learn what drew her to a cold-blooded killer, other than the stereotype of an easy-going girl who is attracted to men of danger. the supporting roles with kanaly, dreyfuss, stanton, lewis, and a briefly-appearing cloris leachman, are acceptable for such talent.as a piece of 1970s exploitation, 'dillinger' appears doomed to retail bargain bins, which is exactly where i picked up mgm's dvd release for $4.99. the film is nicely presented in widescreen (a must for drive-in flicks) with subtitles in french and spanish. dillinger's theatrical trailer is supplied as a lone extra. largely forgotten except by gangster movie fans and drive-in enthusiasts, the film doesn't really call for much else in way of supplementary material. for fans of the genre, it's certainly worth checking out.** out of 4roving reviewer - www.geocities.com/paul_johnr\n",

            "as we all know the sub-genre of sex comedies is pretty crowded. simply being excessively raunchy isn't enough anymore. i've seen and heard so many disgusting jokes and actions that a sex comedy really needs to have other positive points to appeal to me these days.coming into the 40 year old virgin i knew basically what to expect; i did see the commercials after all; \"is it true that if you don't use it, you lose it?\" what i didn't expect to find is a heart and honest attempts at character development. there's still the weird \"off-the-wall\" characters that we see so much in adam sandler movies and there's still enough inappropriate language to sink noah's ark but somehow the movie has a worthwhile love story and yes even a message.the main character andy is (unfortunately for me) a person i can relate to. in the first shot i see that he even shares my love for mystery science theater 3000 (he has a poster for the movie on his wall) and throughout the movie we get to see his really neat collection of antiquities. andy also has plenty of video games and a working knowledge of films and technology. andy doesn't want to buy a car because he prefers his bike. most importantly of all; andy is a nice person, he doesn't swear and he respect women so much that he stays away from them. combine all these factors and everybody begins to think he's a serial murderer. it's like my life story.the other characters each have funny little stories to go along with their slightly exaggerated personalities and they all work on a certain level but not the way andy does. i felt that it was sort of distracting in a way since andy and his girlfriend trish are really the only truly human characters in the entire movie.i suppose since i mentioned one flaw i might as well bring the other noticeable one to light. the story is clever but too predictable and as far as romances go; it's quite simple. it deals with andy's relationship with trish for a long time and we all know what's going to happen in the end. sure its final detour is a bit different than we may expect but you know what's going to happen in the end, and i assure you it does. these are definitely small stains on the movie but there's so much good here that i can easily ignore it's few faults.when i say \"good\" i mean \"bad\" of course. this is a sex comedy and it wants to be bad. for the most part i think it succeeded. there are so many hilarious scenes such as andy trying to get rid of an erection after refusing to have sex with trish. or the scene where andy goes with his trish's daughter to a sexual education class where he ends up asking more questions than anybody else. ah and we must not forget the soon to be classic chest waxing sequence \"ooh! como se llama!\" an interesting little note about that scene; the actor steve carell actually did wax his belly and the pain shown is real. of course they only did one take but it was still a very brave thing to do on his part.actually since we're talking about steve carell, i'd like to say that he has now risen on my list of respected comedians which is sort of odd since i didn't even know who he was prior to seeing this film. i was just so impressed by his writing, acting and timing that i now really want to keep an eye out for his future roles. this man has talent it the 40 year old virgin proves that.to be honest i had doubts about this film but early word was positive and i knew it was something i was eventually going to see. i'm glad that i did too since it's probably one of the funniest movies i've seen in a long time and it doubles as something you feel is worth watching. it's not simply a series of sex gags lumped together rather it's a series of sex gags entwined with a very worthwhile character and a truly touching romance. now excuse me while i go puke my guts out; i can't believe i just wrote that...my review from frider waves: http://friderwaves.com/index.php?page=virgin\n",

            "nb: spoilers within. this great movie is \"about\" so many things, all of them successfully: sci-fi time travel, unstable psychologies, dystopian society, the what-is-real syndrome, gradual undermining of belief systems, worldwide bioterrorism, and a nascent love story.the ramifications of the story's twisted time line stir up loads of heated debate - witness the discussions within this site; or, as an extreme, check out the dissertation at www.mjyoung.net/time/monkeys.html. whew! such temporal emphasis speaks mostly to the brilliant plot, coming from the magnificent work of writers david and janet peoples, not to mention the inspiration of chris marker's \"la jetee.\" without a doubt, this is one of the most successful, fascinating time-travel movies ever conceived. but there are many other levels speaking here.the movie's real genius is to focus on the nasty side effects of time-travel in the mind of james cole (bruce willis, doing the best work of his career here). his journey progresses from gung-ho vaccine-hunting warrior to gradually unhinged victim  and back again. the other broad sweep of the story increasingly emphasizes the personal tale between james and dr. kathryn railly (the wonderful madeleine stowe). i love the simultaneous shifting/opposing viewpoints of these two characters. for me it all comes to a head in the fleabag hotel room scene. by this point, james  once gripped by an unshakable determination  now slumps in utter doubt about his own reality; while dr. railly  the cool and rational scientist  has finally become wildly convinced, after absorbing james's proofs, of his horrific predictions. her desperation to get through to james and hang on to the mission shows how far she's come.gilliam makes us care about these characters, especially through the crescendo of tension threading their lives. the balance held between emotional roller-coaster and mounting sci-fi puzzle/thriller is exquisite. and the denouement at the airport is heart-poundingly intense because we see it coming so clearly through james's dreams. it is here, just after james has decided to quit the whole mess  and is fighting his insanity more than ever  that he steps back up to the plate and does what is necessary for mankind. see jose and the gun (just before this, the references to hitchcock's \"vertigo\" and identity switching/confusion are brilliant.) this is a movie to be hashed out between thinking people; it not only holds up under repeated viewings, it demands them. \"twelve monkeys\" is intelligent, provocative, bizarre, funny, and suspenseful stuff.the supporting cast is excellent, especially brad pitt stealing all of his scenes and showing great flexibility as jeffery goines, crazed and spoiled, but ever the survivor. and there is david morse as dr. peters (interesting how the movie simply leaves to the viewer his wicked motivation) and christopher plummer as dr. goines. but the biggest accolades belong to terry gilliam, surpassing here - just barely - his outstanding \"brazil.\" (lots of parallels, of course, especially the lonely combatant trying to escape his crumbling surroundings: lunacy within, lunacy without.) every frame of this movie has his unique stamp and tone. the soundtrack is terrific, too.this is one of the great achievements of the 90s, a true favorite of mine, and sure to hold up for a long time to come.\n",

            "the person who wrote the review \"enough with the sweating and spitting already\" has no grasp of what cultural, literary, or psycho- critique is. he dismisses zizek's interpretations because they don't seem \"in line\" with what the director originally intended. so what? the importance of a director's (or author's) intention is not important in critical theory. this is known as the author's \"intentional fallacy\" and should be avoided.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intentional_fallacy a text or movie can be analyzed through a number of theories, many of which disagree with one another, as well as completely ignore the author's intention. this is the most fundamental idea of critical theory.because of this, whoever wrote that wall of text wasted a lot of time and effort on insulting zizek. in reality, anyone who studies theory would immediately discredit this guys opinion (i suggest you should too) as it is completely off point.that being said... if you are at all interested in freudian, laconian, or kristevian discourse, this movie is a must. it connects these theories with popular film, making them much more palpable and enjoyable than simply reading or thinking about them.\n",

            "i think james cameron might be becoming my favorite director because this is my second review of his movies. anyway, everyone remembers the rms titanic. it was big, fast, and \"unsinkable\"... until april 1912. it was all over the news and one of the biggest tragedies ever. well james cameron decided to make a movie out of it but star two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship. well, onto the main review but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will be present is an event from the film.so our two main characters are jack (leonardo dicaprio) and rose (kate winslet). they're not annoying too much but watch this and you'll find out why they could become annoying ( http://tinyurl.com/ojhoyn ). the main villain i guess is bad luck, fate, hand of god (no blasphemy intended), or just plain caledon hockley (billy zane). combine all of the above and what do you get?! oh yes! we get a love story on a sinking boat. the supporting characters are the following: my personal favorite, mr. andrews (victor garber)(idk he was so nice), lovejoy(david warner), murdoch(ewan stewart), lightoller (jonathan phillips), captain smith(bernard hill), molly brown(kathy bates), and many more. we also got the present day treasure hunter, brock lovett (bill paxton). they add something to the story, something good. the action in here is awesome, especially in the second half, the drama as also good. in the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears. the story is simple and it works. a treasure hunter seeks the heart of the ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond. she calls and tells her tale on the rms titanic. two lovers separated by social class and ultimately, the fate of the ship. everything about the story works and there are very few flaws. i give titanic, an 86% awesome\n",

            "unlike http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098238/ this movie provides no background information. we are shown a snapshot of the fall of danton, his mock process and execution but, unless one studied the revolution quite extensively, it is difficult to understand where characters come from ( fouquier-tinville, philippeau, desmoulins, robespierre... ) and thus to appreciate them for what they are: danton and joe blobb could be the same person to the viewer. for example robespierre & desmoulins were close friends since their youth, and this explains how robespierre acts. those who know the facts, though, will easily orient themselves and appreciate this good movie with actors delivering solid acting, no useless subplots and good reconstruction of the times. desmoulins and danton are the best characters, but all do a good job, even the 'demented' saint-just portrayed as sort of psychopath. 'terreur' was a period of massacres whose importance hasn't been fully documented and that -for the most part- were driven by ambition, greed and the settling of personal disputes, fed to ignorant sans-culottes as the next epochal step against tyranny.\n",

(maybe that's what the warning about the woods is all about? it's filled with weirdos...and their dogs!?) they let him sit with them only because he has a huge bag filled with cannabis. (their brains are completely intoxicated! no wonder why they are all so dumb!) this is the last time we'll see this forgettable character...alive!henry shows up at their cabin, (note: he was lying all the time a few yards from their cabin!!!) looking worse, almost like a zombie, covered in goo! he says he needs a doctor. but the young einsteins refuse to help the poor sucker. he gets into their unlocked truck which of course also has its key in the ignition. henry almost seems smart enough to drive the hell away from there but instead starts puking blood all over the dashboard, seats and windows. the fantastic five come out running, armed with: a bb gun, a knife, a baseball bat (*huh? ever tried playing baseball in the middle of the woods???), a poker, and a (insecticide?) spray-can, ready to combat the single, unarmed and terribly sick man. (clever script!) bert manages to kill the car with one single shot of his bb gun, which is only possible in the mind of director eli roth. \"what else am i supposed to do?\" bert yells in his defense. jeff and paul try to knock henry down with their bat and poker but miss and crash the truck's windows instead. henry walks up to the dumb girls who say: \"he's coming towards us!\" (thanks for the info, dumb broads, i can see that! but i don't think he wants to do you any harm!) marcy sprays in his eyes, making henry yelp! and our \"hero\" paul touches henry's arm with a burning log from the campfire, which they recklessly left burning while they were inside the cabin! (where has all that wisdom gone? i guess the cannabis had started to take its toll!:-) henry turns into the human torch and runs away, screaming.the following day, bert and jeff head out for a mechanic. and marcy decides to \"go for help\" all by herself, in the woods, as paul stays behind with karen...doesn't that sound idiotic? marcy could have stayed with karen and paul because jeff and bert were already \"going for help\"!i skip my comments now to how we suddenly see marcy in a canoe rowing over a huge and winding river! how did she get a canoe? does she even know where she's going!? anyway, she goes to the riverbank and finds a very big and seemingly abandoned cabin and, like in most horror movies, walks inside the cabin saying:\"hello? is anyone there?\" bert suddenly pops up from behind a furniture and scares her (and me at first). and along comes jeff, as well. how did they get here!? did they swim across the river??? do you see how brainless the script is!?deputy winston meets paul at the cabin. he somehow doesn't notice the blood on their truck. this happens around 35 minutes of viewing and i have decided to stop torturing myself anymore and popped the dvd out. (before i take my own eyes out!...now, that's funny!)if you liked this movie, do yourself a favor and watch \"fright night\", \"the lost boys\", or \"the return of the living dead\". then you'll see they are more entertaining than this...thing. even the \"toxic avenger part 2\", which is also a lousy film, is way more funnier than \"cabin fever\".\n",

            "true stories make the best stories don't they? there's always something enjoyable about a story, be it novel or movie or whatever, simply by the fact that it's real makes the story all the more fascinating. this movie is based on a true story of two young american men, one a government employee and falcon enthusiastchris boyce (timothy hutton)and the otherandrew daulton lee (sean penn)is a drug dealer. these two begin selling government, mostly cia, secrets in 1975 to the soviet union.the film focuses on the human aspect of the two men, as well as their growing personal problems (especially penn's character with ever-worsening drug addictions), rather than glorifying their status as traitors to america, which would, no doubt, hurt the film's credibility in the us. boyce gradually becomes more cautious and eventually frustrated and paranoid as their dealings drag on and they dig ever deeper into treacherous territory. daulton becomes more dependent and addicted to cocaine and heroin as he becomes more frightened, and more desperate to maintain control over a situation he has no control overon top of which, he already has problems with the law. the torment of boyce and daulton's families because of the way they lead their lives is also well portrayed and adds well to the idea that espionage against one's country, even if thought to be done justly, leads only to major problems and the ruination of livesincluding the degradation of the friendship and trust between the two main characters.here's the breakdown:the good:--hutton and penn each did extensive research on the characters to capture their individual look and feel, so they're portrayed with extensive depth and realism.--the acting is excellent.--the atmosphere of paranoia builds quite well.--the story is fascinating, and of course, as one based on actual events, it has some added kick.--nice sets.--the soviets working with the boyce and daulton are portrayed very well, and not stereotyped or given evil consciences just for the sake of making them look bad.didn't hurt it, didn't help:--the music is alright, nothing perfect though.--sound effects are occasionally a little iffysuch was the case with a lot of films from the seventies through the eighties.the bad:--chris boyce (timothy hutton) has a relationship with a woman that we hardly know. because of boyce's trouble brewing with the us and soviet governments, her life can be put in jeopardybut this isn't as expanded upon as it feels it should've been. minor problem, though.the ugly:--the apparent simplicity required to sell government secrets is a little unnerving. nothing like a constant state of unreadiness to keep the masses feeling as unsafe as possible.memorable scene:--seeing the first cia report accidentally sent to the wrong place with the reason being, \"rough night.\"this was another film that suffered massive delays due to the controversial content of the story. studios and producers didn't see how a movie about two american traitors could ever be accepted by american audiences. luckily, it's filmed and portrayed with a high degree of class and quality. of course, it helps that the traitorous anti-heroes aren't portrayed heroicallymore like a couple young men who've made gross errors in judgment in their lives. as such, it becomes a very human drama, and one portrayed very well and very believably.acting: 9/10 story: 10/10 atmosphere: 8/10 cinematography: 8/10 character development: 9/10 special effects/make-up: 8/10 (little quantity, high quality) nudity/sexuality: 2/10 (one scene in a strip club) violence/gore: 7/10 (no gore, just some violence) music: 7/10 direction: 9/10cheesiness: 0/10 crappiness: 0/10overall: 8/10if you like films about espionage and spies, then you can't go wrong here. if you like dramatic films with a strong focus on the humanity of the characters, then this may also work for you. highly recommended.www.residenthazard.com\n",

            "call me old fashioned, but i like movies with plots. i thought \"stoner comedy\" was just a way to more specifically describe a comedy in which lots of weed is smoked and the people watching it are more apt to enjoy it high. \"grandma's boy,\" however, has decided this is a full-blown niche and that stoners represent a piece of the comedy pie that need to be reached. apparently, allen covert (star and producer) and the happy madison gang were right, but that doesn't make \"grandma's boy\" any less boring and unfunny. they might be completely stoned -- but the characters are mostly half-baked.alex (covert, a longtime supporting player for adam sandler, first-time star) is a mid-30s professional video game tester whose roommate has gotten them evicted. he could look for a new apartment, but then we don't have a movie. after trying a couple friends, he ends up living with good ole grandma lilly (doris roberts of \"everybody loves raymond\"). she wakes him up a 6 am and has him do chores and soon he's falling asleep on the job and so the new video game sequel might not get done on deadline.like most people, alex deals with his frustration and eradicates boredom by either playing video games or getting high or both. his friends/co-workers all do the same thing. most of them are virgins that live at home in addition to loving video games. they're all awkward and all with the exception of nick swardson and joel moore (only at times) their characters aren't funny. funny if you're blazed ... sure, i suppose, but i can't say from experience.maybe all we loser guys like is getting high, playing video games and awkwardly ogling women with specific attention on their breasts, but even so, it shouldn't be the driving force of an entire film. neither should old women getting high on accident (saw that one coming) or being the but of gross-out sex jokes -- but that's what happens when a film isn't about anything. no conflict occurs until the last 20 minutes outside of the slight problems of being out of pot, alex trying to get the hot girl (linda cardellini) to like him and the guys scrambling to finish their levels for the video game deadline.characters can be the saving grace for these meandering stoner flicks, but aside from a lovable doris roberts, the aforementioned swardson as the virgin friend who lives with his parents and calls them his roommates and joel moore's skill at making robot noises, there's little character ingenuity. covert is a run-of-the-mill main character with no comedic dimensions, his dealer friend dante is an inept actor and waste of screen time and jonah hill and kevin nealon are written so far into the periphery it doesn't matter.if you like movies about nothing and watching them in a state of mind and body that enhance that nothingness, \"grandma's boy\" will likely be just what you're looking for. those who need a little more talent and wit to get on board with a comedy will be left unaffected. the most i can say for \"grandma's boy\" is that it's watchable despite its pointlessness. it won't feel like a total waste of time but you'll wish you did do drugs so you could at least have made the most of the hour and a half.~steven cvisit my site at www.moviemusereviews.com\n",

            "the united states was still fighting world war ii (the movie was released in between ve day and vj day). any studio worth its salt was either making fighting movies where fearless american soldiers beat the enemy, or americans in general were singing and dancing. technicolor musicals were what america thrived on in the depressing days when everything was rationed. most musicals of the day were simply a bunch of musical numbers strung together with the best available plot slipped in to fill time til the next musical number! i get the feeling now that the people reviewing this movie were all born after 1970. depressing how quickly we forget.this film could've been called \"the search for jose iturbi\" but now everyone wonders why. allow me to explain. from 1929--his arrival in america--until his death in 1980, iturbi was one of the finest pianists to grace a concert stage. he agreed to do a few movies in 1942, but hollywood had been after him for nearly a decade at that time. not only an excellent pianist, but a successful conductor as well, iturbi was very much a household word for more than 40 years. the scene where iturbi and 17 other pianists play one of liszt's rhapsodies was planned early on--and hasn't anyone ever noticed the other pianists were all children? joe pasternak, who produced that movie & many other mgm musicals, credited iturbi with interesting america's youth in classical music. grayson's wanting an audition with iturbi in the movie was not unlike real life at the time. everyone wanted iturbi back then. the joke among soldiers was that \"gi\" meant \"get iturbi\" (he did a lot of concerts at military bases).gene kelly was a great dancer and frank sinatra an excellent singer, but at the time this movie was made sinatra was barely 30 and had only been under contract to columbia records for four years. kelly was already well-known as a dancer, but iturbi had by then been a world-wide sensation for 20+ years.and as to the lack of a plot, americans didn't need plot. they were tired of war, they were sick with fear for their loved ones, and worried about the future. they needed happiness and hope and the assurance that things would work out fine in the end. they needed music and smiles and joy and romance. this movie and others like it delivered just what was needed.enough lecturing. mouse dancing aside, the best scene in the movie occurs between sinatra and iturbi with each of them \"ignorantly\" complimenting the other's music.if you have any interest in jose iturbi, the spaniard who conquered more of america than de soto, cortez, and de leon put together, please drop by my website, www.joseiturbi.com, where you can find a plot summary, excerpts from movie reviews \"of the day\" and pictures from this and certain other mgm musicals of the 1940's, as well as a biography and discography of iturbi.trout\n",

            "to call a film boring is not something i would usually count as a valid criticism. however, when a film is crassly made of spare parts from other films that weren't that good to begin with, and it is slow as molasses with no real payoff, i think it's fair to call a spade a spade. and the ghost is a very boring film.a movie that is about as original as its' name, the ghost tells the story of a young girl with amnesia being haunted by a ghost that holds the secret to her past. only, it's a whole lot more complicated and less interesting than one would think.the plot line is almost incomprehensible for most of the picture and the hook, the amnesia element, only makes things worse. it seems that no one, including the screenwriter and director have any clue what the hell is happening at any given moment. instead they chose to do what roughly amounts to the filmic equivalent of a sitcom clip show. there are scenes taken directly from ringu, dark water, shutter, the grudge series, and a smattering of pulse for good measure. making matters worse, the half dozen female leads all dress and read their lines alike, making them impossible to tell apart.there is just nothing to grasp onto with this film. the story isn't all that well thought out. the amnesia gimmick is lazy. the mystery element is un-involving and handled with little grace. the characters never deduce anything, all the information is just handed out through the lead remembering her past whenever it is convenient for the plot.the cinematography, full of reflections and shots of water at least attempts to add to the subtext, a thematic link with the amnesia and the final twist (which i won't reveal) is nice, but often overwrought. even the score feels borrowed and cliché.worst of all, the inciting action for the curse isn't very interesting and the final twist is predictable and lame. \"wait, you mean that one character who has 15 minutes of screen time but appeared to have nothing to do with the plot comes back in the end? no!\" audiences are too savvy for this kind of tripe. anyone who has seen any of the films that this rips off will find very little to even keep them awake with this feature. i used to think shimizu was the bottom of the barrel for this kind of crap (remaking his grudge film no less than 5 times) but even his second rate work like reincarnation, a film i couldn't even bring my self to finish, is miles ahead of this.for more reviews please visit www.collider.com\n",

            "- contains 1 spoiler, market with: ***** -not presenting itself as yet another remake of \"the interview\", five fingers actually is. alas, besides maybe the hardship of physical torture, it never adds anything to it's predecessor's accomplishment in terms of suspense, plot or performances. in fact, five fingers never gets anywhere near its level. what i found to be in particular painful to watch wasn't the torture itself, but the way martijn (ryan philippe) acted out his ordeal. to me it looked as if philippe tried too hard to get his accent right and it made his performance glibly amateur which in turn even dragged down the performance of an otherwise great colm meaney. phillipe's accent btw, being far from anything near dutch, sounded more like eastern european. besides the acting of philippi(which to my surprise turned from poor to actually decent towards the end) there is the matter of the flashbacks with the hackneyed dutch scenery. (if these scenes were set in switzerland they would have had the cast eat cheese on mountaintops with endless pastures with grazing cows wearing expensive timepieces). scenery aside, the way these flashbacks pushed the plot didn't work for me at all. it made it being served like french fries at a drive-in and caused the build-up of suspense to flatline.admittedly the movie did become more enjoyable as phillipe's acting improved but i couldn't help being annoyed every now and then with scenes that were just too implausible. e.g.: ************ start spoilerat some point (after days) philippe is almost tenderly washed by the female terrorist. this only to be followed by the brute severing of yet another finger. why give the guy a wash if he's in for a torture? and the severing of that last finger seemed to only serve the title of this flick anyway, i mean, he was practically begging to have it knifed off. didn't make sense************ end spoilerwhat ultimately kept me watching was the performance of fishburn who once again proved to be a brilliant actor but who also had the best part of the script to work with.all in all one is just far better off seeing \"the interview\" with that other matrix-icon: hugo weaving. and when you do, i'm confident you won't find this review that disagreeable.3.5/10\"the interview\", 1998 www.imdb.com/title/tt0120714/\n",

            "ecstasy (1933) (usa 1940) starring hedy lamarr (as hedy kiesler)the world's first glimpse of a 19 year-old hedy lamarr occurs in the early moments of this 1930's treasure as she sweeps across the screen in an angelic wedding gown. this was to be the start of a legendary career. this was our glorious introduction to the most beautiful woman ever to grace the silver screen.it is eva's (lamarr) wedding night and her older husband seems uninterested in her romantic advances. she retreats to the lonely bed and, in a beautiful scene, she fiddles with her wedding ring as the realization of her marital mistake overcomes her. the husband seems more interested in neatness and order than he does in love. gustav machaty uses gorgeous camera angles and pristine shot framing to capture lamarr's considerable talent and beauty. with no words spoken in the early part of the film, she is able to grasp our sympathy, our hearts and our support. it is that combination that prepared the 1930's audiences for what they were about to see as the film unfolded. 'ecstasy' was considered shocking for its time... some thought it to be scandalous.she returns home to her father's estate and files for divorce. the next day, she wakes with a complete sense of freedom and happiness. she just has to go outside and feel the freedom of the countryside and fresh air. eva goes for a horseback ride and happens across a beautiful lake. and in one of the most famous scenes in film history, hedy lamarr became the first person to ever appear nude in a major film. her frolic in the woods and her skinny-dipping adventure in the lake were legendarily scandalous. but the audiences couldn't stay away. as with many of today's movies, the controversy made it a must-see film.eva's mischievous adventure introduces her to a handsome young man who helps her find her horse, who had run off with her clothes. after an awkward meeting, they eventually fall for each other. their first romantic rendezvous was almost as controversial as the nude scene, with its blatant waves of eroticism. however, machaty does beautiful work in these romantic moments. machaty creates one delightful moment, when eva literally seems to sink into her new lover, using a gorgeous early camera trick.it cannot be overstated how brave this performance was on lamarr's part. many might have presumed it was career suicide. instead, it gained her worldwide fame and caught the eye louis b mayer, who signed her to a contract with mgm. there are some truly erotic moments in this film, even by today's raunchy standards. it is impossible to imagine how they were received in the 1930's. again, machaty was very clever with his imagery, leaving a lot to the imagination. but we all understand very well what we are seeing and it is supremely well done.the meeting of eva's former husband and her current lover is perhaps inevitable. however, the consequences of that meeting are not. the film takes a few unexpected turns in its final act and it all makes for a great story and a lovely debut on the grand stage of movie stardom for hedy lamarr.i highly recommend this once controversial, now tame film and urge you to seek it out in its restored form on dvd. it is easily worthwhile, if only for the pleasure of seeing hedy lamarr. but the story is compelling too and the direction is ahead of its time. 'ecstasy' is a memorable early treasure.www.tccandler.com - tc candler's movie reviews!!!\n",

            "nope, i am just not going to get with it here. i refuse to go along with the program. don't you supposed that perhaps this movie is just a tad over-rated? look at the reader comments and their star ratings: most are 6/10, 7/10 or better. i think this is an instance when the ratings may say more about the people rendering them than the movie itself, which is unique. how many other sex fantasies about simulated bestiality complete with horse couplings have become mainstream hits as catalog dvd titles? i watched this movie with a pervading sense of anticipation, expecting fireworks, and instead got someone popping a gucci shopping bag. it looked great, but once the thrill had been spent even the twist ending didn't do much to save it.the film's background story says it all: director films about 25 minutes of borderline hardcore fake bestial sex for another movie, is informed the footage will not be appropriate, sets it aside, waits two or three years for a smattering of critical acclaim to build up, then constructs an entire feature around that 25 minutes, filming roughly 70 minutes of otherwise unrelated, excruciatingly boring footage and inserting the 25 minute chunk in as a dream sequence. that the 25 minutes of film in question is strikingly odd, original and shocking in a deliberate, calculated manner goes without saying. but we aren't here to evaluate that 25 minutes alone, we must consider the entire film, and ask ourselves why people are so enthusiastic about the movie? or are they just enamored by it's background story and history of having been banned by people who were stupid enough to be offended by it?perhaps it is an anti-clerical agenda that appeals to them. hating the western religions of catholicism and christianity is one of the few remaining socially acceptable bastions of intolerance -- just today it was revealed that the bbc routinely skews their broadcasts with anti christian & anti western sentiment in the furtherance of political correctness. you can say anything you want about the bible, pedopheliac priests, the institutionalized cruelty of the church, and how much white men and their inhuman religions suck the dimpled skin off a golf ball ... but say one negative thing about non-westernized religions, and you are toast. this movie was tailor made for such a sentiment, with a wrinkly old dried up priest who has an entirely unwholesome on screen relationship with two pretty 14 year old french boys complete with inappropriate touching, fawning, fondling, fumbling, groping, and patting of the backsides. ewww.and then there is the horse couplings, photographed in such fetishistic closeup detail that portions of the film could be used as visual aids for a biology class on animal husbandry. yes i understand the thematic relevance of the imagery -- large animal phallus's with a wealth of reproductive fluids just waiting to be unleashed like fire extinguishers -- but if i wanted to watch horses, you know, do it, i would like go live on a farm. having their genitals in my face is about as entertaining as watching someone use a bathroom.is this movie just a sort of artsy diversion for social deviants? probably, though i will grant the artistic execution of most of it, filmed in a kind of arty euro detail that even has a dappled forest pond right out of a monet painting, complete with a spanning arched bridge. and the ending (which even i managed to be surprised by) does sort of wrap it all up into a neat if distasteful package. but you have to remember that there are certain things that cannot be deconstructed for their design elements and many artists are guilty for exploiting them in their work to lend a sort of gravitas that would not have been achieved without it. that isn't fair, and even clint eastwood has fallen prey to the urge with his new movie about iwo jima. whether or not his film is any good stands as a separate consideration from whether or not that battle was a noble cause fought by men who were heroes. the problem is that most people will not be able to separate out the two aspects of the movie and will be lining up to give it oscars because of it's noble message -- not because it is a particularly good or original movie.while it may seem like an odd parallel, i see one with the beast: how can anyone not see the basic beauty of nature in the sight of two horses mating? and who cannot see the logical culmination of the repressed sexuality from fairy tales in the film's explosive set-piece where beauty and the beast finally do the nasty? somehow i managed to miss both points, and am delighted that i have seen this film so that i can trash it as being what it really is: 25 minutes or so of eye opening over the top adult fairy tale imagery surrounded by 70 minutes of skull drainingly boring artsy-fartsy euro trash dreck about some guy getting a haircut, and a great ending. it's art for sure, but it sucks hard.3/10\n",

usually violence is at least done well!the ugly:--the idea that dean koontz whored out his brilliant novel to become this filthy f*cking piece of sh*t brings me dangerously close to vomiting all over myself and anyone near me. there are movies worse than this (headache-inducing as that idea may seem), but so far, only \"alien vs predator,\" at least to me, is a bigger travesty and more painful disappointment. memorable scene: watching the end credits start.acting: 3/10 story: 4/10 (the novel was really good, this is just terrible) atmosphere: 5/10 cinematography: 4/10 character development: 1/10 special effects/make-up: 4/10 nudity/sexuality: 0/10 violence/gore: 4/10 music: 5/10 direction: 3/10cheesiness: 7/10 crappiness: 9/10overall: 3/10i would recommend that no one watch this movie ever, except for a few extreme die-hard horror fansand only if you haven't read the novel. instead, i would recommend that anyone interested in this avoid it entirely and buy/check/borrow the book.www.residenthazard.com\n",

            "inarguably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years, werner herzog has been pushing the boundaries of cinema perhaps more so than any other commercial filmmaker. i've been acquainted with herzog for a few decades now and i've never not been impressed by both the man and his work. last year i went to see rescue dawn and was somewhat surprised at how relatively mainstream the film was, yet couldn't help but imagine herzog taking his actors and crew into the actual jungle to not only make the film, but to live it. no other filmmaker is as crazed about the purity of the film-making process and the subsequent lore from such productions as fitzcarraldo has been forged into cinematic legend.today i sat down to fata morgana, a 1969 herzog film that could be described as an allegorical filmic postcard. without researching the actual locations, i'm assuming it was shot somewhere in africa, both coastal and desert, a region that could have once been the cradle of infant man, infant civilization, infant life on earth. it is these origins, the biblical notion of the garden of eden and the apocalypse that herzog is concerned with, as is voiced by the narration dispensed throughout the 79 minute run time.watching fm i couldn't help but feel i was a passenger on a profound journey. in the opening sequence, the title is translated as \"mirage\" and herzog juxtaposes this translation with multiple repetitions of commercial jets landing on an airstrip. these images are perverted, their 3-dimensionality crushed flat by a long lens, piling layers of exhaust, heat waves and light aberrations all on top of one another. the effect left me to conclude: things are not as they seem.fm is divided into 3 very distinct chapters: 1) creation, 2) paradise and 3) the golden age. chapter one, opens with countless, languid images, where bleak, barren landscapes scroll by, dead animals rot, broken shells of crashed airplanes and abandoned cars slowly disintegrate in the desert sun. the people populating this inhospitable landscape are ragged, unsmiling and apparent prisoners of the desert. the narration talks of a time before life, a time where the canvas of earth was blank and all that existed were the heavens. while the narration hearkens to a simpler, purer era, a portrait of a young boy holding a fox-like animal by its throat evokes a chilling depiction of man's cruel, ruthless attempt to enforce a dominion over nature.in the next chapter we are introduced to more of the same, yet the images and people are more animated and seem infused with a modicum of life and vitality. we listen to a goggled biologist talk about the difficultly a monitor lizard has hunting for prey in such a lifeless environment. as he holds the squirming monitor, its tongue flicking at flies, he also describes how difficult it to capture these creatures in the searing 140 degree heat. the parallel is duly noted and herzog continues to explore this concept through repeated, candid portraits of individuals battered by the sun, the desert and the laborious efforts required to exist in this harsh realm. he also pushes forward the theme that if not in control, man asserts his control over his environment and not always in the most pleasant of ways.the last chapter takes us out of the desert's blast furnace and into the more familiar herzog territory populated by eccentrics and absurd behavior. no one seems to have a more effective symbiotic relationship with the oddballs of the world than herzog -- possibly this is where he feels most at home. much like errol morris, herzog chooses to place his camera in as seemingly objective a position as he can before he lets the film roll. the subsequent flirtation herzog has with his subject is the result of him being able to continue shooting well beyond the point when most directors would have yelled cut. as morris does, this extended roll pushes past the \"on\" moment the subjects feel obliged to offer and through their discomfort of being pushed into overtime, their facade gives way to something real. the most humorous portrait in this chapter is of the 2 person band playing an odd, polka-like song that herzog recycles throughout this chapter. the drummer of the band wears the same goggles as the biologist, as does another guy doing a magic trick, begging the question: what's with the goggles? they definitely add some levity to the film, but one has to wonder if they hold any deeper meaning or significance, or is this just another example of herzog's playfullness.the narration aside, herzog utilizes folk and blues music as the experimental documentary's soundtrack. leonard cohen grabs the most screen time, two of his beautifully melancholic songs \"so long marianne\" and \"suzanne.\" perfectly accompany the scrolling landscapes, adding to the convincing feel that we are truly along for the ride. by the end of the journey, herzog comes back to one of the many shots that recur throughout the film: the distant framing of a lone vehicle traversing the endless desert engulfed by a water mirage that fills the horizon. despite the overall bleakness of fm, the crescendo of the film and the mirage motif leave you with a hopeful spirit, belief that against all odds, life will persevere and possibly even flourish.having finished writing this post, i referenced fm to discover that herzog shot it in saharan cameroon only weeks after a bloody coup. true to his legend, herzog and his crew were arrested, beaten and imprisoned. while imprisoned, herzog fell ill with schistosomiasis, a blood parasite. it's truly hard not to love such a hypnotic and austere film as fata morgana; knowing the filmmaker was willing to die to get it made only makes you respect it all the more.http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/\n",

            "i had watched this film from ralph bakshi (wizards, hey good lookin'), one night ago on www.afrovideo.org, and i didn't see anything racial (i am not stupid), i do admit the character designs are a bit crude and unaccpectable today, but i think it's a satire and a very,very urban retelling of the old uncle remus stories that the black american culture, created right down to the main characters and the blatant nod to \"the tar baby\" and \"the briar patch.\" these aren't bigoted stories, mind you, but cultural icons created by black americans, and me being a white woman read and love those stories. and i also found it an interesting time-capsule view on the black culture in harlem, new york in the 70's.well to get to the nitty-gritty of this film: this film is a live-action/animated film, which begins in live-action with a fellow named sampson (barry white) and the preacherman (charles gordone) rush to help their friend, randy (philip michael thomas) escape from prison, but are stopped by a roadblock and wind up in a shootout with the police. while waiting for them, randy unwillingly listens to fellow escapee pappy (scatman crothers), as he begins to tell randy the animated story of brother rabbit, a young newcomer to the big city who quickly rises from obscurity to rule over all of harlem; you know, to me rabbit,bear and fox are animal versions of randy,sampson and the preacherman. an abstract juxtaposition of stylized animation and live action footage, the film is a graphic and condemnatory satire of stereotypes prevalent in the 70s  racial, ethnic, and otherwise.so anyway, it is another good bakshi movie; and should we sweep films like this under the rug? pretend they never exist? hmmm...i think that would be a shame; i think we should watch these films entacted, and learn about what goes on back then, just how far we come since then.\n",

            "the 63 year reign of queen victoria is perhaps one of the most documented and popularly known historical reigns in british history. on the one hand, her story lacks the theatrics of earlier royals thanks to a change in social climate and attitudes, and on the other her story is one that perpetuates because it is notably human. taking on the earlier years of her life where the budding romance between herself and the german prince albert was taking forefront, director jean-marc vallée who has only until recently remained in the unbeknownst shadows of the industry here takes victoria's story and captures that human element so vital to her legacy. it's a story that feels extremely humble considering its exuberant background, and yet that's partly what gives it a distinct edge here that separates it from the usual fare.taking a very direct and focused approach that centres in on a brief five or so year period between her ascension and marriage to albert, the young victoria does what so little period pieces of this nature offer. instead of attempting a sprawling encapsulation of such a figure's entire life, vallée instead opts to show one of the lesser known intricacies of victoria's early years which are easily overlooked in favour of the more publicly known accolades. the result is a feature that may disgruntle historians thanks to its relatively flippant regards to facts and the like, yet never to let document get in the way of extracting a compelling story, writer julian fellowes sticks to his guns and delivers a slightly romanticised yet convincing portrayal. vallée takes this and runs, making sure to fully capitalise on those elements with enough restraint to maintain integrity in regards to both the history involved and the viewer watching.a major part in the joy of watching the young victoria play out however simply lies in the production values granted here that bring early 1800's regal britain to life with a vigorous realism so rarely achieved quite so strikingly by genre films. everything from the costume designs, sets, hair styles, lighting and photography accentuates the grandiose background inherent to victoria's story without ever over-encumbering it. indeed, while watching vallée's interpretation come to life here it is very hard not to be sucked in solely through the aesthetics that permeates the visual element; and then there's the film's score also which works tremendously to further the very elegant yet personal tones that dominate fellowes' script. entwining the works of schubert and strauss into victoria and albert's story not only works as a point of reference for the characters to play with, but also melds to the work with an elegance and refrain that echoes composer ilan eshkeri's original work just as well.yet for all the poignant compositions, lush backdrops and immaculate costumes that punctuate every scene, the single most important factor hereand indeed to most period dramasare the performances of the cast and how they help bring the world they exist in to life. thankfully the young victoria is blessed with an equally immaculate ensemble of thespians both young and old that do a fantastic job of doing just that. between the sweet, budding romance of victoria (emily blunt) and albert (rupert friend) and the somewhat antagonistic struggles of her advisors and the like (spearheaded by a terrific mark strong and paul bettany), the conflicts and warmth so prevalent to fellowe's screenplay are conveyed perfectly here by all involved which helps keep the movie from being a plastic \"nice to look at but dim underneath\" affair so common with these outings.in the end, it's hard to fault a work such as the young victoria. it's got a perfectly touching and human sense of affection within its perfectly paced romance, plus some historical significance that plays as an intriguing source of interest for those in the audience keen on such details. of course, it may not take the cinematic world by storm and there lacks a certain significance to its overall presence that stops it from ever becoming more than just a poignantly restrained romantic period drama; yet in a sense this is what makes it enjoyable. vallée never seems to be striving for grandeur, nor does he seem content at making a run-of-the-mill escapist piece for aficionados. somewhere within this gray middle-ground lies the young victoria, sure to cater to genre fans and those a little more disillusioned by the usual productions; beautiful, memorable but most of all, human.- a review by jamie robert ward (http://www.invocus.net)\n",

            "already his first claim, that desires are always artificial, is totally fallacious.when a jehovah witness reject gets his own documentary on movies  or anything for that matter - it's time for anyone to get their own. although far, far more intelligent than, say, paris hilton (i know, not too difficult) zizek's mouth spews just as much baloney as hers, just a different kind. he combines the worst from both his professional worlds: psychoanalysis and philosophy. both fields are notorious for conveniently offering the expert b*lls***osopher plenty of leeway to create unprovable theories, to rant without a beginning or end, and to connect concepts almost randomly, in the process misusing the english language by creating a semantic jumble only a mother can love. example: there are three main marx brothers hence what a \"great\" idea to connect them with three levels of human consciousness, the id, the ego and the super-ego. i'm kind of surprised he didn't play a clip from \"snowhite\" and make an analogy between the seven dwarfs and the seven levels of gahannah (moslem hell). it's like the premise of schumacher's \"the number 23\": play with numbers long enough, and you can come up with any kind of cockamamie theory you want, even linking ancient greeks with princess di's death.however, there is an entertainment element to tpgtc: watching a raving lunatic sweat like a hog while uttering delusional chants masked as intellectual analysis can be quite a lot of fun. why watch \"cuckoo's nest\" or any other madhouse drama when you can have zizek for more than 2 hours? it's like watching an amusing train wreck. admittedly, he is almost funny on one or two occasions.i have always been mystified by people who desperately try to elevate movie-making into an exalted intellectual social science. giving idiotic movies like \"birds\" this much thought, hence this much credit, probably has its fat creator laughing in his grave. the raw truth is that the vast majority of movies have zero intellectual value, and the few ones that do have some intelligence don't require a shrink-turned-philosopher to draw one a map to understand them  unless one is a complete idiot. zizek sees layers and layers of meaning in the most banal movies. hallucinogenic drugs must be rather popular and cheap in slovenia these days...when zizek showed the bathtub hole in the \"psycho\" shower scene, i thought he was going to say something about galactic black holes; how they drain the life out of stars just as the bathtub hole sucks in janet leigh's blood. or perhaps he could have said how the hole represents leigh's vagina, with the blood flowing into it instead of out (as in menstruation), this representing some kind of \"clever (zizekian) irony\". speaking of which, the real irony is that if hitchcock had really put that much thought into every scene (and the script), his movies wouldn't have been the illogical, far-fetched crap that they often are. the point of these bathtub hole analogies was to show just how easy it is to improvise about \"hidden, deep meanings\". and when you add zizek's fanciful terminology from philosophy and psychology, layering these terms on top of these analogies like wedding cake decorations, you get a rambling jumble that can instantly impress the uneducated - i.e. the easily impressionable and the gullible.zizek utters a number of (unintentionally) funny things here, one of the most absurd ideas being when he associates anthony perkins's cleaning of the bloodied bathroom with \"the satisfaction of work, of a job well done\". don't laugh... neither hitchcock nor the writer of \"psycho\" could have ever even vaguely entertained this notion that perkins might be enjoying a job well done - the cleaning of a blood-stained toilet - while they were conceiving/directing that scene. talk about putting words into one's (dead) mouth, but in the context of misinterpreting what the director had to \"say\".i like zizek's initial thoughts on tarkovsky's terrific \"solaris\", but then he has to ruin a rare good impression by dragging in \"anti-feminism\" and other nonsense into his theory.zizek's attitude towards logic is that of a dog toward its plastic bone. \"i just want to play with it all day!\" logic has its rules, and is not supposed to be raped - at least not publicly - by the likes of him. he seems to regard logic, proof, common-sense, and reason as enemies or mere throwaway toys; concepts to be either avoided, twisted to fit the end-goal, or simply annihilated. zizek is the lsd-tripped hippie, and all his favorite movies are his own personal \"2001\"s.the fact that zizek over-focuses on two of the most overrated directors - and ones whose films often lack intelligence, if anything - such as hitchcock and lynch, only further diminishes his already low credibility. i was surprised de palma didn't feature more prominently; that's another lame director who writes inept scripts. zizek has a field day with lynch's incomprehensible \"lost highway\". there are just as many interpretations of that movie as there are people who watched it.zizek's comment that the viewer readily accepts von trier's laughable, \"ground-breaking\" physical set-up in \"dogville\" made me snicker. however, zizek doesn't only make up stuff as he goes along, he also indulges heavily in the \"bleedin' obvious\". like all \"social scientists\" (an oxymoron), he wraps his very trite \"observations\" into articulate (if full of spitting) and sometimes complex blankets of language. after all, sociology functions in precisely the same way: it makes us believe we are hearing something new when in fact it's what we already all know, but told in an eloquent way - which fools the more unobservant listener.i was half-expecting for men in white suits to suddenly appear out of nowhere and strap him up in a loonie-suit...slavoj zizek: soon as a stalker in a kid's park near you.http://rateyourmusic.com/list/fedor8/150_worst_cases_of_nepotism/\n",

            "walt disney's \"the rookie\" is based on the story of jim morris, a former minor league picher who made one of the most amazing comebacks in sports history, ending an almost 10 year retirement and making his major league debut in 1999 at the age of 35.the film opens with a brief synopsis of morris' childhood, which included a series of re-locations - his father was a military man. and even when his family settled for good in football crazed texas, morris' passion for baseball remained strong.the childhood segment then jumps ahead about 23 years to the adult morris (played by dennis quaid) who is now a baseball coach and chemistry teacher at big lake high school (in real life it was reagan county high school in big lake, texas). it is mentioned that he attempted a career as a baseball player but that it didn't work out.morris's team is struggling and he lectures them about giving up on their dreams. they turn the table on him, telling him that he should try out for a major league team. at several times when he pitches to them in practice, they express amazement at the speed with which he throws. morris seems unconvinced but agrees to a deal with his players in which if they win district, he will try out for a major league team.big lake does win district and, adhering to his end of the deal, morris attends a tampa bay devil rays try out. phenomenally, he throws 98 miles an hour - faster than he threw during his minor league career and an outstanding speed even for a major league pitcher. after another try out with the team, morris is offered a contract with the devil rays.this leaves him with a tough decision - stay in his comfortable life or once again pursue his major league dream by going through the minor league grind of making little money and spending months at a time away from home. and the decision is even more agonizing than during his first minor league stint because he now has a wife and three children.morris signs with the devil rays, begins at the aa level and moves up quickly to the aaa level, one level below major league baseball. but as the season winds down, the chances of him getting \"called up\" grow increasingly slim.for the most part, i love this movie. there are lots of great performances and likable characters and it's easy to find yourself really pulling for morris. also, the movie does a great job portraying professional baseball at both the major and minor league levels. and most of all, it teaches the timeless message of holding tight to your dreams even when they seem distant and almost impossible to achieve.still, the movie has some flaws. while generally accurate, it exaggerates and even fabricates a few things. check out http://espn.go.com/page2/s/closer/020410.html for some examples. also, except for one scene in which he prays with his players, the movie completely ignores morris' christian faith. but considering disney's left wing zeal, that's not surprising.presumably, a lot of the exaggerations/fabrications were done to make the story more dramatic. yet the 20 minute documentary on morris that is included on the dvd features some information that makes his story more dramatic but is excluded from the movie.for example, from birth until his family settled in texas for good when he was 12, morris re-located 14 times. and his initial minor league career ended after four surgeries through which he lost half of the muscle in his left (pitching) shoulder, thus making his throwing 98 mph even more inexplicable.to fully appreciate and understand the story of jim morris, it's good to not only watch \"the rookie\" but to watch the dvd's documentary, check out the aforementioned link to the movie's inaccuracies and probably also to read morris' biography, also titled \"the rookie.\" i haven't read the book but i hope to one of these days.but overall, \"the rookie\" is a very good portrayal of a miraculous story and is a powerful testament to the power of dreams and the triumph of the common man. 8/10\n",

            "i have lost count of how many reviews i've written on slaughter high. i've read a lot of bad ones and i will say right now this is a fantastic movie. simon scuddamore made his fame in a short time for his well known suicide, and even though this was his only film, he is what made the movie so great. at first i did not know anything about simon until i read a review about his suicide. then i found out due to the current webpage at www.imdb.com he was born in 1957, in dayton, ohio. simon may have played the most pathetic character known to man, but his real life self certainly had their strenghths and weaknesses. he did a good acting job, who can disagree? i always wondered how he felt showing himself naked in a movie. must have been pretty embarrassing to say the least. i first saw this movie when i was 12 in the sixth grade. i agree with some pointers like the girl would not take a bath after somebody was murdered, and that high schools do not have bath tubs! i think caroline munro who was 36 at the time was the only other star that had any dignified acting talent, and unfortunately for simon's death he made no future films. the reason(s) for his suicide are a mystery, and hopefully will be discovered in the near future. doing the math on his webpage it tells you he was 29 years old when he made slaughter high. he looked like a teenager. i give this film two thumbs up, the best horror film made. probably because of their horrible acting the others didn't make fame in the movie business. -jacob young\n",

(there is a likely candidate for this)-even a sleigh ride and most heartwarming of all is that the taxi driver, whose engine is broken is mysteriously given a new one on christmas morning and no-one had engineered it! there is a lovely moment where denver sings a lullaby and an exciting search. great gentle film for everything christmas is really about.\n",

            "a vehemently cynical, sarcastic and intense film, mocking and imitating the style of pulp fiction and stylized gangster films, thursday is an entertaining, off-putting and hilarious thrill-ride. an amazingly eclectic mix of over-the-top characters and bizarrely entertaining situations, this day-in-the-life of a gunman trying to go straight proves to be a worthy addition to the series of films that attempts to mimic the genius of tarantino's dark-humored masterpiece pulp fiction.nick (aaron eckhardt) stops by casey's (thomas jane) house to catch up on old times. casey was a former gunman for drug dealers who has since reformed, become an architect, married a successful businesswoman (paula marshall), and is now contemplating adopting a child. nick, who still has ties to the gangster underworld, leaves a briefcase full of drugs at casey's house while he borrows his car to run a few errands a.k.a. unfinished business. disgusted and angered by the introduction of drugs into his home, casey flushes them all down the kitchen sink. that's when, one at a time, nick's double-crossed accomplices, rapping rastafarian drug messengers, and crooked cops all come a-knocking for the unsuspecting casey, who is about to have one unbelievable thursday.the film opens with a hilarious sequence in a gas station in which nick is looking for the best deal for a cup of coffee. after pondering which size cup to get, a fiasco breaks out with the cashier when he demands a free snackie cake and uses a $50 bill to pay. resulting in comically brilliant bloodshed, the situation goes from bad to worse when a cop intervenes and is caught in the most unusual of circumstances. this opening segment establishes the perfect mood for the rest of the film, which never takes itself too seriously and includes outrageous characters that seem self-aware of their own existence in this nonsensical gangster flick.the film is broken into segments based on various events and times during the course of one day. this effect is much like pulp fiction, which is a similarly given chapters, although thursday doesn't mess with chronological order except for the occasional flashback. also like tarantino, music magnificently introduces each scene and each character. oddly humorous creatures, such as the jamaican hit-man pizza delivery guy that raps over the phone and shares his hashish, and paulina porizkova's narcissistic dallas, who attempts to rape casey, add humor to each event regardless of how horrifying and unnerving some of the coincidences are. when mickey rourke's calmly spine-chilling crooked cop kasarov is introduced, the careful staging and intricate setup is fully assembled, and casey's sticky situation becomes even more daring and laudable.definitely a wannabe pulp fiction, with plenty of violence, witty dialogue and extremely creepy antagonists, thursday does some things right, but other attempts at homage may be going just far enough as to suggest rip-off. a flashback sequence that shows casey shooting up baddies and sporting a hairstyle that exactly matches john travolta's do in pulp fiction is easily one step too far.- mike massie, www.moviepulse.net\n",

            "(48 out of 278 people found this comment useful, and counting...)people are such suckers for image and looks - as much as for the intellectually hollow \"idealism\" that lurks behind communism. che's charisma and looks have as much to do with his iconic stature as the misinformation that has been spread by leftist propaganda (such as this movie) about him.i don't know what's worse: being captured by one of che's murder-squads or having to sit through 4 hours of this typically soderberghian garbage. the question isn't why this pet-project was made but what took them so long. by \"them\" i'm referring, of course, to left-wing hollywood and its \"secret\" love of marxist tyrants (lenin, castro... take your pick). i am fascinated that it took decades for one of tinseltown's least talented liberal directors to finally take on such an irresistibly biased propaganda project. where was oliver stone all these years? robert redford? tim robbins? warren beatty? alan pakula? george clooney? barbra streisand even? it's a mystery. all these overrated \"artists\" have often indulging themselves in similar, politically one-sided projects, yet somehow che guevara, who is arguably the most popular and well-known communist, hasn't been a film topic of theirs yet.\"guerrilla\" has all the hallmarks of an american truth-bending story of an epic scale; there is as much factual detail to be found here as in other similar hollywood big-budget political fairy-tale bios such as \"malcolm x\" or \"gandhi\", i.e. almost none. the movie stars del toro as the famous argentinian revolutionary. nevertheless, however controversial and criminal this man's actions may have been, one thing nobody could take away from him: he was an intelligent manipulator who came from a rich family - which is why del toro fits the bill only visually. del toro may be an interesting, charismatic actor and he may resemble guevara physically, but he exudes no intellectual qualities whatsoever, hence he makes guevara come off as too primitive. casting such mediocrities as bratt, philips and franka incompetente only underlines the director's lack of sound judgment.the movie is to the most part extremely slow (no surprise there), and visually uninteresting. even a director as brilliant as kubrick would have carefully considered releasing a movie that goes beyond the 3-hour mark, so it's quite telling that this soderbergh, who has only made one or two solid movies and early on in his career, would think that his oceanic grandness was up to the task. if you think the film's length indicates that a bulk of che's life has been shown here - then think again. soderbergh focuses on che's last phase, and a lot of the movie is tedious jungle nonsense, full of guevara's alleged idealism. (psychopaths don't have ideals.) i do wonder what kind of a mind this highly esteemed director has to have to actually choose to ignore some of che's earlier life. did he actually consider it too uninteresting? a massacre of 600 people holds no interest for the viewer, huh? amazing. some much better directors than this over-praised charlatan would have easily fit not one but two complete biographies into a 4-hour movie.soderbergh, in a sense, becomes an accomplice by never addressing the negative, dark side - which is more than 90% - of guevara. by spreading this kind of historical inaccuracy, consciously ignoring the ugly truth (god forbid he should taint the holy image of che), soderbergh proves himself not a humanist - a fake image which most hollywood and pop music personalities struggle very hard all their careers to uphold - but the opposite: that he cares only about ideas, never about the people on whom these ideas are tested (like on guinea pigs). soderbergh and the like are elitists of the worst kind; such people often have a latent contempt for the \"proleteriat\" (what a stupid term) they're supposedly siding with.half of all students around the world wear che's image on their red and orange shirts, but without ever knowing why. he has become an iconic figure for clueless, uninformed, very often young people, who think that by having this man's face on their chest that somehow makes them appear \"edgy\", intellectual, hip or interesting. in reality, wearing a che shirt only underlines one's overall shallowness and total disinterest in self-education. (wouldn't you want to find out more about a person before you start advertising his/her face to the world?) wearing che's by-now cliché image has become as common as having a bart simpson coffee cup. all those \"che-wearers\" probably know more about marge's blue hair than they'll ever read up on about fidel castro's dead ally.after everything that'd been done in the name of marx, one would think that these mongrel \"ideals\" would be finally laid to rest. it seems mankind will never learn. stalin, mao, kim il, pol pot, castro, milosevic, ceausescu, the iron curtain, a hundred million dead, more than a billion ruined physically and/or mentally through this system... so none of that matters, huh? the fact that del toro won a cannes award should only surprise those who are absolutely clueless as to how cannes and other european festivals work - and vote. hint: sean penn headed a jury not long ago.for my music-related rants, go to: http://rateyourmusic.com/collection/fedor8/\n",

            "this movie is based on the true story of christopher boyce and his friend daunton lee. this fascinating story takes place around the time of the whitlam dismissal, in which during his time as a clerk for trw, christopher was privy to classified correspondence which admitted the cia's involvement in australian political and union circles. the movie shows several scenes involving gough whitlam (transmitted over us tv), where events take place which confirm the classified documents that christopher had read previously. the removal of gough whitlam was an organized cia coup. elsewhere in the film, it was mentioned that most people have no idea about the level of deception that goes on, ultimately to ensure that the us is used as a vehicle to promote certain policies at the behest of everyone else. in the current age, nothing has changed.christopher's life was profoundly affected, read shocked, by his knowledge of what and how the cia shapes foreign democracies, including the democracies of allied nations to the united states. christopher reacted, probably not in the best way at the time, by selling top secret information to the soviet union with daunton lee acting as his exchange. eventually christopher and daunton were captured and convicted of treason.on 23rd may 1982, whilst serving time in us prison, christopher boyce agreed to a one and only interview with ray martin of 60 minutes australia because it was the australian connection that profoundly affected him. it caused a furore in the australian media for about a week, then it went hushed.i liked the movie's symbolism of the falcon, and in it chris was called the falcon, and daunton the snowman (drug connection), but in reality the title \"falcon\" was not something that was used by chris.christopher boyce: criminal or man of conscience? you decide.resources: http://www.playitforwardoz.com/boyce.html\n",

            "i swore i would never allow myself to devolve into to the bogus authority figures of the sixties who told me things were better in the \"good old days\"  the current australian prime minister is a sordid example of just such a mind set.but i switched over to \"a decade under the influence\" because i found watching the much-heralded \"sneakers\" documentary on the other channel such a dispiriting experience. i found the values expressed by the \"sneakers\" interviewees too ugly to accept as reasonable. so materialistic! so devoid of any sense of outrage at a society that can countenance killing someone to steal his very ugly shoes! so lacking in any worthwhile purpose that they can report without distaste the exploitation an audience by haranguing them to hold those shoes above their heads to lock in a sponsorship deal for themselves with a company of cobblers was just too much to continue watching.\"a decade under the influence\" depicted a completely different response to the fruit of stupidity, corruption and concupiscence in high (and low) places.i have noted the change in film-making that accompanied the exposure of america's disastrous foreign policy debacles in vietnam and so many less reported places in my www.peterhenderson.com.au website. \"a decade under the influence\" documents the precise moment at which that change took place.before the seventies, the armed forces were depicted in american films as an invincible fighting force comprised of decent human beings who transmogrified into conquering heroes on the battlefield. after the seventies they are generally portrayed as a dispirited rabble misled by a bunch of bureaucrat clowns in the pentagon before the seventies, the fbi agent and the honest cop tended to be depicted as your friend and protector. after the seventies, the fbi agents were all incompetent and the best a cop could aspire to was to ignore their foolishness and his superior's corruption and uphold justice in his own idiosyncratic manner.before the seventies, the archetypical american \"little guy\", the \"average joe\", the jimmy stewart type would face down the problems encountered and thereby gain some insight into underlying wisdom of his elected leaders and justice of the \"american way\". after the seventies, kevin costner usurps that role, but now he is the voice of one crying out in the wilderness for evil to be exposed, or accepting his lot and making out the best he can.and now those \"old time religion\" mindsets have been stripped of any honesty and righteousness and portrayed (with a certain amount of justification) as sanctimonious bigotry and self-serving hypocrisy.\"a decade under the influence\" tells it like it was. \"a decade under the influence\" tells it like it is now. it depicts the redemption of the american film industry from the hands of the artistically, morally and intellectually bankrupt studio moguls. it shows the storming of the hollywood bastille by the independent film makers who promised to get a disillusioned and tired audience back into the cinemas. the fact that their failures were numerous, and at times disastrous, merely underlines the greatness of their achievement. an achievement reflected in the adventurous and questioning attitudes of the big box office stars such as clooney, daman, affleck etc and the directors and producers who provide the vehicles for their talent.\n",

            "i think that most people would agree with me if i were to say that the movie alien pretty much set the bar for atmosphere. i've seen quite a few movies match that bar but none have ever exceeded alien's eerie tunnels and darkened halls. the cave is a film that tries very hard to reset the bar. i believe the trailer even mentioned something about being as scary as alien yet not once throughout the movie did i ever feel even the slightest bit scared, or thrilled for that matter.so now that we got the ball of negativity rolling i might as well explain why the cave's main hook (the atmosphere in case you weren't paying attention) fizzled into a waste of my time. i'll say right now that most of the sets were gorgeous and nicely lit but what we hear and what we know is there tend to ruin what we see. the music for one is terrible. we either get corny rock music or over exaggerated haunted house music. okay maybe that's pushing it a bit but i couldn't bear it. the many underwater scenes were bad enough (it's a well-known fact that underwater scenes are always boring as hell) i didn't need rock music blaring in my ears while they were simply swimming through a cave. this actually produced a lot of unintentional laughter that was then amplified by the following watercraft crash scene.anyway as i already mentioned, it wasn't just the music that killed the atmosphere, heck no. the creatures hiding amongst the darkness are supposed to invoke horror. i'm supposed to be worried that they are going to appear and merely a glimpse of them is supposed to make my blood turn cold. the cave does wisely take a page from the alien handbook by not showing the entire creature for very long and leading up to the reveal with only glimpses but it just doesn't work because the creatures are so lame. i guess it would be rude to spoil the specifics but they are basically the aliens with wings.i guess you get the point by now. atmosphere ruined. yet i know plenty of people who will still see a movie if it's exciting. i'd like to say that about the cave but i'd be lying. this movie is slow to get to the action and once we get there we sort of wonder when the thing is going to finally call it a day. we've seen all this done better before with the exception of a few neat scenes (the guy impaled on stalactites, the eel and the rapids) so you really don't get any thrills from watching people running from uninspired alien knockoffs in endless tunnels.ah but no the pain doesn't end there. we must also take the characters and acting into account. well i can't remember a single line of dialogue other than \"run!\" and the only character's name i can remember is jack but that's only because it's placed in almost every other line near the end of the movie. perhaps the actors were capable but the script didn't allow them to do anything other then run and argue. they had almost no background and whenever somebody died they simply shrugged it off. it's pretty sad when you consider that the cgi eel puts on the best performance in the film.speaking of cgi; there's plenty of it, most of which is terrible. i do commend them on using suits (at least i think they were suits) but nothing truly meshes with the environment and as a result most of the effects end up looking pretty hokey.so i guess to wrap it up, the cave is bad and has very little going for it. had the film been a scifi channel premiere movie or low budget direct to video release i might have a bit more love for it but this film was a theatrical release. with more wit and talent this might have been a frighteningly fun movie but as it stands this film is about as scary as going into the basement and that's not very good.my review from frider waves: http://friderwaves.com/index.php?page=cave\n",

            "if you read my review of syfy's \"dinoshark\", you know that i can appreciate the low-budget schlock that these made-for-television movies can provide. they're stupid...they're silly...but they're still pretty fun in a \"so bad, it's good\" kind of way. so, still smacking with guilt for liking (and recommending) the undeniably hokey \"dinoshark\", i sat down to watch \"hammerhead: shark frenzy\", a syfy original movie about a half-man, half-hammerhead monster terrorizing people on an island. with the syfy channel's sure-fire recipe for creating b-movie creature features and a cast that includes william forsythe and hunter tylo, how could it possibly go wrong? well, to my surprise, it actually misses the mark...not by much, but enough to make me not recommend it. why? well, first of all, its titular monster, the dreaded hammerhead-human hybrid, takes a backseat to a bunch of faux-military thugs who really become the movie's primary villain. though the hammerhead does rack up the body count, he (or it or whatever you call the thing) only arrives just before someone is going to be munched upon and leaves directly after. the rest of the movie is filler, pitting our heroes against the aforementioned soldiers. that, to me, is just not as compelling as watching a walking hammerhead eat people! please read the full review on my blog: www.horrormoviejournal.blogspot.com\n",

            "this movie contains the worst acting performance of all time. spilsbury lacks energy to say the least. energy is what clayton moore gave us in spades. i never felt once in this movie that spilsbury was anxious for anything. revenge, love, justice? not in this guy's portrayal.there is also no chemistry between tonto and lr. if the plot did not force them to be friends, you don't get the impression they want to hang out with each other. plus, the sidekick has the more interesting personality. ewww.the dialogue is predictable and boring.the narration is stunningly bad and if you are familiar with the dukes of hazzard you can picture what this is like. i cannot believe the director would agree to this. it insulted me as a viewer by explaining every plot line i just witnessed.hey, at least the horses and locations looked good, maybe that is what happens when you hire a cinematographer to be your director.rating-2 you may be able to watch this one for laughs or to demonstrate to an alien what a bad movie is.\n",

            "trite and unoriginal. it's like someone watched immortal beloved and amadeus and decided to mix them together and, in the process, steal other formulaic plot parts from other movies to make another one. as with most historical movies nowadays, there are some inaccuracies as history is manipulated to better suit the story, which is understandable for the most part. for example, during the remaining days of beethoven's life, it was necessary for other people to write down what they needed to say in order for him to understand them. that, of course, would have been a nuisance to have to show on screen. the script, although filled with some quotable lines, doesn't quite capture the feel of that time period and, coupled with some bad acting, seems rather contemporary. diane kruger is nice enough to look at but she still has lots to improve on her craft. ed harris doesn't work for me as beethoven and i mostly blame gary oldman for that. overall, not a very good interpretation of the musical maestro's life. better just find yourself a copy of immortal beloved.http://iwascalledclementine.multiply.com/reviews\n",

            "trick or treat, quickie review this zany romp of a film revolves around the 80's culture of heavy metal and horror movies--two things which i love dearly. so, as you can imagine, this movie appealed to me pretty easily. plus, for no apparent reason, ozzy osbourne plays a preacher.this film is about an unpopular high school youth who, like all us losers, ended up drenched in a world of \"evil\" heavy metal. his favorite metaldude dies and, of course, is miraculously resurrected--by playing his latest unreleased album backwards. this allows the corpsified singer to go around killing people with demons and sh*t helping out.okay, it's pretty cheesy at times, but you know what? it's got a surprising number of good qualities. decent acting (including gene simmons as a radio dj), pretty good special effects, very brief nudity, decent atmosphere... all in all, it's actually a decent horror film. but what really sucks is the music. ironic, huh? well, this \"uber-evil\" metal guy is one of the most obnoxious, high-pitched, wailing, motley crue rejects on the planet--and the \"metal\" is little more than putrid 80's pop/hair metal. he hits all the cliché's here, from prancing around like a gay fairy, to looking mean, to screaming \"rock and roll!!!\" in a pitch high enough to make king diamond retch. aside from that atrocious musical representation, it's actually pretty good. 7/10www.residenthazard.com\n",

(the story contains violent images generally on a par with those of various sci-fi channel offerings).the story has subplot, ethical and moral comment on the nature of humanity and ends not on one of those horrible \"did they really kill all the monsters???\" moments, but rather leaves you guessing completely and in an entirely different mindset.which is generally what science-fiction is supposed to do, no?\n",
